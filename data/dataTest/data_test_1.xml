        <Title>Factors associated with worsening oxygenation in patient with non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia Factors associated with worsening oxygenation in patient with non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: This study aimed to determine parameters for worsening oxygenation in non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia in a public hospital in South Korea. The worsening oxygenation group was defined as those with SpO2 â‰¤ 94%, or received oxygen or mechanical ventilation (MV) throughout the clinical course versus the non-worsening group who were without any respiratory event. Parameters were compared, and the extent of viral pneumonia from an initial chest CT were calculated using artificial intelligence (AI) and measured visually by a radiologist. Results: We included 136 patients with 32 (23.5%) in the worsening oxygenation group, of whom two needed MV and one died. Initial vital signs and duration of symptoms showed no difference between the two groups, however, univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that a variety of parameters at admission were associated with an increased risk of a desaturation event. A subset of patients were studied to eliminate potential bias, that ferritin â‰¥ 280 Î¼g/L (p=0.029), LDH â‰¥ 240 U/L (p=0.029), pneumonia volume (p=0.021), and extent (p=0.030) by AI, and visual severity scores (p=0.042) were the predictive parameters for worsening oxygenation in a sex-, age-, and comorbid illness-matched case-control study using propensity score (n=52). Conclusion: Our study presents initial CT evaluated by AI or visual severity scoring as well as serum markers of inflammation at admission are significantly associated with worsening oxygenation in this COVID-19 pneumonia cohort.</Abstract>

        <Title>Intensive care nurses' experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study Intensive care nurses' experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, health care systems worldwide are working under challenging conditions. Patients, who are seriously ill, require intensive care admission. In fighting COVID-19, nurses are frontline health care workers and, as such, have a great responsibility providing needed specialized patient care in intensive care units (ICU). However, working conditions and emotional factors have an impact on the quality of the care provided. Aim: The purpose of the present study was to explore and describe the experiences and perceptions of nurses working in an ICU during the COVID-19 global pandemic. Study design: Qualitative research was undertaken, using an empirical approach and inductive content analysis techniques. Methods: The selected population consisted of ICU nurses from a tertiary teaching hospital in Spain. Data were obtained via semi-structured videocall interviews from Apr 12th to Apr 30th, 2020. Subsequently, transcribed verbatims were analysed using the template analysis model of Brooks. Findings: A total of 17 nurses comprised the final sample after data saturation. Four main themes emerged from the analysis and 13 subthemes: "providing nursing care," "psychosocial aspects and emotional lability," "resources management and safety" and "professional relationships and fellowship." Conclusion: Providing health care by intensive care nursing professionals, during the COVID-19 pandemic, has shown both strong and weak points in the health care system. Nursing care has been influenced by fear and isolation, making it hard to maintain the humanization of the health care. Relevance to clinical practice: Implications for practice include optimizing resource management (human and material), providing psychological support, and adequate training for ICU nurses, as well as high-quality protocols for future emergency situations.</Abstract>

        <Title>Delivery of digestive surgery services during the COVID-19 pandemic: Indonesian Society of Digestive Surgeons online survey Delivery of digestive surgery services during the COVID-19 pandemic: Indonesian Society of Digestive Surgeons online survey</Title>
        <Abstract>Introduction: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, digestive surgery potentially exposes both health-care professionals and vulnerable patients to COVID-19. A survey was conducted with aim to determine the digestive surgery services provided during the COVID-19 pandemic, optimize safety for patients and clinicians, and safeguard health-care services. Methods: An online survey was conceived and circulated to members of the Indonesian Society of Digestive Surgeons. The survey was conducted in two phases, in April 2020 and July 2020, to evaluate changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Early in the pandemic (April 2020), the median number of major digestive surgeries performed monthly declined from 20 cases (range. 3-100 cases) to 1 case (range. 0-10 cases) (P &lt; .001; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Most of the cases in April 2020 addressed emergency problems, but more definitive surgeries were performed during the later period of the survey. The importance of screening for COVID-19 with polymerase chain reaction has increased over time, and a more comprehensive screening methodology incorporating real-time polymerase chain reaction, chest CT, and rapid antibody test were evident in 31.37% of July 2020 responses. Conclusion: Our survey has shown that surgeons adapted to the evolving pandemic and continue to do so only with appropriate safety assurances.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>The COVID-19 pandemic urged both scientific community and health care companies to undertake an unprecedented effort with the aim of understanding the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and developing effective therapeutic solutions. The peculiar immune response triggered by such virus, that seems to last only few months, induced to look for alternatives such as passive immunization in addition to conventional vaccinations. Convalescent sera, monoclonal antibodies selected among the most potent neutralizing binders induced by the virus infection, recombinant human single-domain antibodies and binders of variable scaffold and different origin have been tested alone or in combination exploiting mono and multivalent/multispecific formats. In this review we analyze the state of the advancement of the research in this field and present a summary of the ongoing projects finalized to identify suitable molecules for therapies based on passive immunization.</Abstract>

        <Title>Haemostasis in coronavirus disease 2019 - lesson from viscoelastic methods: a systematic review Haemostasis in coronavirus disease 2019 - lesson from viscoelastic methods: a systematic review</Title>
        <Abstract>Haemostatic unbalance is often observed in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and patients with severe disease are at high risk of developing thromboembolic complications. Viscoelastic methods (VEMs), including thrombelastography (TEG) and thromboelastometry (TEM), provide data on the nature of haemostatic disturbance. In this systematic review, we assessed the performance of TEG and TEM in the assessment of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with COVID-19. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, medRxiv and bioRxiv were systematically searched for clinical studies evaluating TEG and/or TEM variables in COVID-19 individuals. Ten studies, with a total of 389 COVID-19 patients, were included, and VEMs were performed in 292 of these patients. Most patients (90%) presented severe COVID-19 and required mechanical ventilation. TEG and TEM variables showed that these patients displayed hypercoagulability and fibrinolysis shutdown, despite the use of appropriate thromboprophylaxis. However, the mechanism underlying these phenomena and their clinical significance in COVID-19 patients who developed thrombosis, is still not clear. Further studies are warranted if VEMs might help to identify those at highest risk of thrombotic events and who therefore may derive the greatest benefit from antithrombotic therapy.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Background: Currently, the data regarding the effectiveness and safety of tocilizumab as treatment for COVID-19 infection is still conflicting. This study aims to give clear evidence regarding the potential benefit and safety of tocilizumab in improving the outcome of COVID-19 patients. Methods: We systematically searched the PubMed and Europe PMC database using specific keywords related to our aims until November 1st, 2020. All articles published on COVID-19 and tocilizumab were retrieved. Statistical analysis was done using Review Manager 5.4 software. Results: A total of 38 studies with a total of 13 412 COVID-19 patients were included in our analysis. Our meta-analysis showed that tocilizumab treatment is associated with reduction of mortality rate from COVID-19 [OR 0.54 (95% CI 0.42-0.71), p&lt;0.00001, I 2=79%, random-effect modelling], but did not alter the severity of COVID-19 [OR 1.05 (95% CI 0.92-1.20), p=0.47, I 2=84%, random-effect modelling] and length of hospital stay [Mean Difference 1.77 days (95% CI -0.61-4.14 days), p=0.15, I 2=97%, random-effect modelling]. Tocilizumab also does not associated with serious adverse events compared with standard of care treatment [OR 0.91 (95% CI 0.71-1.15), p=0.42, I 2=46%, random-effect modelling]. Conclusion: Our study does not support the routine use of tocilizumab for COVID-19 patients. Future studies should focus more on other potential therapies for COVID-19 patients.</Abstract>

        <Title>The role of serum specific- SARS-CoV-2 antibody in COVID-19 patients The role of serum specific- SARS-CoV-2 antibody in COVID-19 patients</Title>
        <Abstract>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has rapidly spread, resulting in considerable casualties and serious economic loss worldwide. Disease severity and related symptoms markedly vary among individuals. A large number of patients present atypical symptoms, which represent a big challenge for early diagnosis and prompt infection source isolation. Currently, COVID-19 diagnosis predominantly depends on nucleic acid tests (NAT) for SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens, but this method presents a high rate of false negative results. Therefore, serum antibody measurement has been rapidly developed as a supplementary method with the aim of improving diagnostic accuracy. Further, serum antibody levels might help to identify the infection stage, asymptomatic carriers, and patients with diverging severities and to monitor convalescent plasma therapy. In the current review, we aim to present comprehensive evidence to clarify the utility of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in COVID-19 patients as a reference for use in the clinic.</Abstract>

        <Title>Assessing the risk of COVID-19 from multiple pathways of exposure to SARS-CoV-2: Modeling in health-care settings and effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions Assessing the risk of COVID-19 from multiple pathways of exposure to SARS-CoV-2: Modeling in health-care settings and effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions</Title>
        <Abstract>We assessed the risk of COVID-19 infection in a healthcare worker (HCW) from multiple pathways of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in a health-care setting of short distance of 0.6 m between the HCW and a patient while caring, and evaluated the effectiveness of a face mask and a face shield using a model that combined previous infection-risk models. The multiple pathways of exposure included hand contact via contaminated surfaces and an HCW's fingers with droplets, droplet spray, and inhalation of inspirable and respirable particles. We assumed a scenario of medium contact time (MCT) and long contact time (LCT) over 1 day of care by an HCW. SARS-CoV-2 in the particles emitted by coughing, breathing, and vocalization (only in the LCT scenario) by the patient were considered. The contribution of the risk of infection of an HCW by SARS-CoV-2 from each pathway to the sum of the risks from all pathways depended on virus concentration in the saliva of the patient. At a virus concentration in the saliva of 101-105 PFU mL-1 concentration in the MCT scenario and 101-104 PFU mL-1 concentration in the LCT scenario, droplet spraying was the major pathway (60%-86%) of infection, followed by hand contact via contaminated surfaces (9%-32%). At a high virus concentration in the saliva (106-108 PFU mL-1 in the MCT scenario and 105-108 PFU mL-1 in the LCT scenario), hand contact via contaminated surfaces was the main contributor (41%-83%) to infection. The contribution of inhalation of inspirable particles was 4%-10% in all assumed cases. The contribution of inhalation of respirable particles increased as the virus concentration in the saliva increased, and reached 5%-27% at the high saliva concentration (107 and 108 PFU mL-1) in the assumed scenarios using higher dose-response function parameter (0.246) and comparable to other pathways, although these were worst and rare cases. Regarding the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions, the relative risk (RR) of an overall risk for an HCW with an intervention vs. an HCW without intervention was 0.36-0.37, 0.02-0.03, and &lt;4.0 Ã— 10-4 for a face mask, a face shield, and a face mask plus shield, respectively, in the likely median virus concentration in the saliva (102-104 PFU mL-1), suggesting that personal protective equipment decreased the infection risk by 63%-&gt;99.9%. In addition, the RR for a face mask worn by the patient, and a face mask worn by the patient plus increase of air change rate from 2 h-1 to 6 h-1 was &lt;1.0 Ã— 10-4 and &lt;5.0 Ã— 10-5, respectively in the same virus concentration in the saliva. Therefore, by modeling multiple pathways of exposure, the contribution of the infection risk from each pathway and the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19 were indicated quantitatively, and the importance of the use of a face mask and shield was confirmed.</Abstract>

        <Title>The JANUS of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases onset during COVID-19 - A systematic review of the literature The JANUS of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases onset during COVID-19 - A systematic review of the literature</Title>
        <Abstract>The diverse clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is emerging as a hallmark of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. While the initial target of SARS-CoV-2 is the respiratory tract, it is becoming increasingly clear that there is a complex interaction between the virus and the immune system ranging from mild to controlling responses to exuberant and dysfunctional multi-tissue directed autoimmune responses. The immune system plays a dual role in COVID-19, being implicated in both the anti-viral response and in the acute progression of the disease, with a dysregulated response represented by the marked cytokine release syndrome, macrophage activation, and systemic hyperinflammation. It has been speculated that these immunological changes may induce the loss of tolerance and/or trigger chronic inflammation. In particular, molecular mimicry, bystander activation and epitope spreading are well-established proposed mechanisms to explain this correlation with the likely contribution of HLA alleles. We performed a systematic literature review to evaluate the COVID-19-related autoimmune/rheumatic disorders reported between January and September 2020. In particular, we investigated the cases of incident hematological autoimmune manifestations, connective tissue diseases, antiphospholipid syndrome/antibodies, vasculitis, Kawasaki-like syndromes, acute arthritis, autoimmune-like skin lesions, and neurologic autoimmune conditions such as Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. We screened 6263 articles and report herein the findings of 382 select reports which allow us to conclude that there are 2 faces of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2, that include a benign virus controlling immune response and a many faceted range of dysregulated multi-tissue and organ directed autoimmune responses that provides a major challenge in the management of this viral disease. The number of cases for each disease varied significantly while there were no reported cases of adult onset Still disease, systemic sclerosis, or inflammatory myositis.</Abstract>

        <Title>COVID-19 and chronic fatigue syndrome: Is the worst yet to come? COVID-19 and chronic fatigue syndrome: Is the worst yet to come?</Title>
        <Abstract>There has been concern about possible long-term sequelae resembling myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome in COVID-19 patients. Clarifying the mechanisms underlying such a "post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome" is essential for the development of preventive and early treatment methods for this syndrome. In the present paper, by integrating insights pertaining to the glymphatic system and the nasal cerebrospinal fluid outflow pathway with findings in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and COVID-19, I provide a coherent conceptual framework for understanding the pathophysiology of post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome. According to this hypothesis, this syndrome may result from damage to olfactory sensory neurons, causing reduced outflow of cerebrospinal fluid through the cribriform plate, and further leading to congestion of the glymphatic system with subsequent toxic build-up within the central nervous system. I further postulate that patients with post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome may benefit from cerebrospinal fluid drainage by restoring glymphatic transport and waste removal from the brain. Obviously, further research is required to provide further evidence for the presence of this post-viral syndrome, and to provide additional insight regarding the relative contribution of the glymphatic-lymphatic system to it. Other mechanisms may also be involved. If confirmed, the glymphatic-lymphatic system could represent a target in combating post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome. Moreover, further research in this area could also provide new insights into the understanding of chronic fatigue syndrome.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>This study aimed to analyze the possible impacts on the prison population's mental health in the context of the new COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative study was carried out following a lexical and content analysis using the software IRaMuTeQ, version 0.7 alpha 2, in the speech of the short communication and headlines from newspapers. Three groups emerged from the analysis: "spatial conditions for infection" (39.2% of the text segments); "disease outbreaks in prisons" (30,4%) and "public responsibility" (30,4%). Precarious conditions of prisons, high rate of infections and psychiatric illnesses, and lack of government assistance are issues that should be given special attention in order to formulate health promotion and prevention policies focusing on mental health in prison population.</Abstract>

        <Title>Fear and depression linked to COVID-19 exposure A study of adult twins during the COVID-19 pandemic Fear and depression linked to COVID-19 exposure A study of adult twins during the COVID-19 pandemic</Title>
        <Abstract>Millions of people have been impacted by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic worldwide. High infection rates and death tolls, combined with social distancing measures, may have unintended psychological consequences on individuals. The goal of this study was to examine the interrelations between COVID-19 exposure, fear of COVID-19, and depression among a community-based sample of adult twins. We further explored whether fear of COVID-19 mediated the association between COVID-19 exposure and depression. 732 same-sex adult twin pairs (78.1% MZ, 21.9% DZ) completed an online survey examining their feelings in May 2020. About one-fifth of the participants reported having any COVID-19 exposure. Most participants (&gt;80%) were somewhat concerned about themselves or their household members being infected by COVID-19. The average depression level was relatively low (M = 0.9 out of 6). We found that COVID-19 exposure was related to increased fears of COVID-19 and depression, and that depressive feelings increased with fear of COVID-19. The correlation between COVID-19 exposure and depression was partially mediated by fear of COVID-19. However, these associations were confounded by familial influences. As society navigates through the pandemic, it is essential to implement public health strategies to help individuals cope with the concerns and fears about COVID-19.</Abstract>

        <Title>A rapid review of the pathoetiology, presentation, and management of delirium in adults with COVID-19 A rapid review of the pathoetiology, presentation, and management of delirium in adults with COVID-19</Title>
        <Abstract>Background COVID-19 causes significant morbidity and mortality. Despite the high prevalence of delirium and delirium-related symptoms in COVID-19 patients, data and evidence-based recommendations on the pathophysiology and management of delirium are limited. Objective We conducted a rapid review of COVID-19-related delirium literature to provide a synthesis of literature on the prevalence, pathoetiology, and management of delirium in these patients. Methods Systematic searches of Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, LitCovid, WHO-COVID-19, and Web of Science electronic databases were conducted. Grey literature was also reviewed, including preprint servers, archives, and websites of relevant organizations. Search results were limited to the English language. We included literature focused on adults with COVID-19 and delirium. Papers were excluded if they did not mention signs or symptoms of delirium. Results 229 studies described prevalence, pathoetiology, and/or management of delirium in adults with COVID-19. Delirium was rarely assessed with validated tools. Delirium affected &gt;50% of all patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU. The etiology of COVID-19 delirium is likely multifactorial, with some evidence of direct brain effect. Prevention remains the cornerstone of management in these patients. To date, there is no evidence to suggest specific pharmacological strategies. Discussion Delirium is common in COVID-19 and may manifest from both indirect and direct effects on the central nervous system. Further research is required to investigate contributing mechanisms. As there is limited empirical literature on delirium management in COVID-19, management with non-pharmacological measures and judicious use of pharmacotherapy is suggested.</Abstract>

        <Title>Assessing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on urban transportation and air quality in Canada Assessing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on urban transportation and air quality in Canada</Title>
        <Abstract>The global outbreak and spread of COVID-19 had a significant impact on the environment of urban areas. This study aimed to provide a new insight into the urban transportation and air pollutant emission of representative Canadian cities impacted by this pandemic. The consumption of urban transportation fuel was analyzed and the corresponding CO2 emissions was evaluated. The changes in urban traffic volume and air pollutant concentrations before and after the outbreak of this pandemic was investigated. Due to the lockdown after the outbreak of COVID-19, the domestic consumption of motor gasoline and estimated CO2 emissions from urban vehicles in Canada has continuously decreased with a lowest level in April 2020, and rebounded in May 2020. It will still take a long time to recover to pre-pandemic levels because of the upcoming second wave of pandemic and further change. The Air Quality Health Index (AQHI), level of urban congestion and concentration level of NO2 and CO had strong relevance with the COVID-19 period while SO2 did not show significant relation. The comprehensive analysis of changing fuel consumptions, traffic volume and emission levels can help the government assess the impact and make corresponding strategy for such a pandemic in the future.</Abstract>

        <Title>Utility of the antigen test for coronavirus disease 2019: Factors influencing the prediction of the possibility of disease transmission Utility of the antigen test for coronavirus disease 2019: Factors influencing the prediction of the possibility of disease transmission</Title>
        <Abstract>Objectives: Rapid antigen test (RAT) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has lower sensitivity but high accuracy during early-stage compared to reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). We aimed to investigate the concordance between the RAT and RT-qPCR results, and their prediction of disease transmission. Methods: This single-center retrospective observational study conducted from March 6 to June 14, 2020, included COVID-19 inpatients. We used nasopharyngeal swabs to perform RAT and RT-qPCR. The primary endpoint was concordance between RAT and RT-qPCR results. The secondary endpoints were the factors causing result disagreement and estimated transmissibility in RT-qPCR positive cases with mild symptoms. Results: Overall, 229 viral transport media (VTM) samples were obtained from 105 patients. The positive and negative concordance rates for VTM were 41% vs. 99% (Îº 0.37) and 72% vs. 100% (Îº 0.50) for samples collected on disease days 2-9. Body temperature increase (odds ratio [OR]: 0.54) and absence of drugs with potential antiviral effect (OR: 0.48) yielded conflicting results. RAT was associated with the ability to end isolation (OR: 0.11; 95% confidence interval: 0.20-0.61). Conclusions: The RAT and RT-qPCR results were highly consistent for samples collected at the appropriate time and could be useful for inferring the possibility of transmissibility.</Abstract>

        <Title>B Cell Depletion and Signs of Sepsis Acquired Immunodeficiency in Bone Marrow and Spleen of COVID-19 Deceased B Cell Depletion and Signs of Sepsis Acquired Immunodeficiency in Bone Marrow and Spleen of COVID-19 Deceased</Title>
        <Abstract>Objectives: In COVID-19, the adaptive immune response is of considerable importance and detailed cellular immune reactions in the hematological system of patients with severe SARS-CoV2-infection are yet to be clarified. Methods: Here, we provide a morphologic characterization of both bone marrow (BM) and spleen (SPL) in 11 COVID-19 deceased with respect to findings in the peripheral blood and pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 burden. Results: In the BM, we found activation and left shift in at least 55% of patients, which was mirrored by anemia and granulocytic immaturity in the peripheral blood as well as thromboembolic events. In the setting of abscess-forming superinfection of COVID-19 pneumonia, we found signs of sepsis acquired immunodeficiency. Furthermore, we observed a severe B cell loss in the BM and/or SPL in 64 % of COVID-19 patients, which was reflected by lymphocytopenia in the blood. These findings were associated with higher pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 load and only marginally decreased T cells as compared to patients with B cell preservation. Conclusions: Our results suggest that sepsis-related immunodeficiency might aggravate the progress of COVID-19. Furthermore, our findings indicate that lymphocytopenia in COVID-19 is accompanied by B cell depletion in hematopoietic tissue, that might impede the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2.</Abstract>

        <Title>Validation of self-collected buccal swab and saliva as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 Validation of self-collected buccal swab and saliva as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: Effective management of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 requires large-scale testing to identify and isolate infectious carriers. Self-administered saliva and buccal swabs are convenient, painless and safe alternatives to the current healthcare-worker (HCW) collected nasopharyngeal swab (NPS). Methods: A cross-sectional single centre study was conducted on 42 participants who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via NPS the past 7 days. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed and cycle threshold (CT) values were obtained for each test. Positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA) and overall agreement (OA) were calculated for saliva and buccal swabs, and compared with NPS. Results: Among the 42 participants, 73.8% (31/42) tested positive via any one of the 3 tests. With reference to NPS, the saliva test had PPA 66.7%, NPA 91.7% and OA 69.0%. The buccal swab had PPA 56.7%, NPA 100% and OA 73.8%. Conclusion: Self-collected saliva tests and buccal swabs have only moderate agreement with HCW-collected NPS swabs. Primary screening for SARS-CoV-2 may be performed with a saliva test or buccal swab, with a negative test warranting a confirmatory NPS to avoid false negatives, minimize discomfort and reduce the risk of spread to the community and HCWs.</Abstract>

        <Title>Low vitamin D status is associated with coronavirus disease 2019 outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis Low vitamin D status is associated with coronavirus disease 2019 outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: Observational studies suggest that the risk and clinical prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are related to low vitamin D status; however, the data are inconsistent. Objectives: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between low vitamin D status and COVID-19. Methods: The systematic search was conducted with PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from database inception to September 25, 2020. The standardized mean difference (SMD) or odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were applied to estimate pooled results. Random - or fixed - effect models based on heterogeneity were used for the meta-analysis. Funnel plots and Egger regression tests were used to assess publication bias. Results: A total of 10 articles with 361, 934 participants were selected for meta-analysis. Overall, the pooled OR in the fixed-effect model showed that vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 (OR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.05). In addition, COVID-19-positive individuals had lower vitamin D levels than those with COVID-19-negative individuals (SMD = -0.37, 95% CI = -0.52 to -0.21). Significant heterogeneity existed in both endpoints. Funnel plots and Egger regression tests revealed significant publication bias. Conclusions: This systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that low vitamin D status may be associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of vitamin D supplementation on the clinical severity and prognosis in patients with COVID-19.

        <Title>Passive immunization and its rebirth in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic Passive immunization and its rebirth in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic</Title>
        <Abstract>The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to a rapid search for therapeutic and preventive measures. The impetus for this is the potentially severe course of infection. In regard to drug therapies, the antiviral drug, remdesivir, and the anti-inflammatory agent, dexamethasone, have shown some beneficial effects. Since a COVID-19 vaccine is not currently available, various additional treatment options are being evaluated. One of these, passive immunization, has shown promise in some studies. More research, however, is needed to determine the utility of immunotherapy with convalescent plasma or artificially produced monoclonal antibodies, for the treatment of symptomatic patients and potentially for use as post-exposure prophylaxis, at least until more effective drugs or a safe and effective vaccine become available.</Abstract>

        <Title>Self-assembled mRNA vaccines Self-assembled mRNA vaccines</Title>
        <Abstract>mRNA vaccines have evolved from being a mere curiosity to emerging as COVID-19 vaccine front-runners. Recent advancements in the field of RNA technology, vaccinology, and nanotechnology have generated interest in delivering safe and effective mRNA therapeutics. In this review, we discuss design and self-assembly of mRNA vaccines. Self-assembly, a spontaneous organization of individual molecules, allows for design of nanoparticles with customizable properties. We highlight the materials commonly utilized to deliver mRNA, their physicochemical characteristics, and other relevant considerations, such as mRNA optimization, routes of administration, cellular fate, and immune activation, that are important for successful mRNA vaccination. We also examine the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines currently in clinical trials. mRNA vaccines are ready for the clinic, showing tremendous promise in the COVID-19 vaccine race, and have pushed the boundaries of gene therapy.</Abstract>

        <Title>Association between physical activity and subjective memory decline triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic: Findings from the PAMPA cohort Association between physical activity and subjective memory decline triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic: Findings from the PAMPA cohort</Title>
        <Abstract>Implementation of social distancing reduced the incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases. Nevertheless, this strategy has other undesirable effects such as physical inactivity and psychological distress, which are associated with cognitive impairment. We aimed to examine whether physical activity during social distancing restrictions could reduce the risk of subjective memory decline in adults. Participants (n=2321) completed the baseline assessment of PAMPA cohort (Prospective Study About Mental and Physical Health), a ambispective cohort study conducted in southern Brazil. An online-based, self-administered questionnaire assessed physical activity and self-rated memory in two different periods: before and during social distancing. Data collection was executed from June 22nd to July 23rd 2020. Adjusted Poisson regression models were performed and values reported in prevalence ratio (PR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Participants presented with a mean age of 38.2 (95%CI: 37.5, 38.9) years. Most were women (76.6%), had at least a university degree (66.7%), and were overweight or obese (53.3%). Subjective memory decline was reported by 30.0% (95%CI: 27.7%, 32.4%) of respondents. Most individuals with subjective memory decline reported being physically inactive during the pandemic of COVID-19. Participants were less likely to experience subjective memory decline if they either became (PR: 0.56; 95%CI: 0.36, 0.89) or remained (PR: 0.68; 95%CI: 0.49, 0.93) physically active compared to inactive respondents. Physical activity participation during social distancing reduced the likelihood of subjective memory decline in adults. Physical activity should be highlighted as a potential alternative to reduce the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on cognitive function and mental health.</Abstract>

        <Title>Geographic Variation in Racial Disparities in Mortality from Influenza and Pneumonia in the US in the Pre-COVID-19 Era Geographic Variation in Racial Disparities in Mortality from Influenza and Pneumonia in the US in the Pre-COVID-19 Era</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: In 2018, influenza and pneumonia was the 8th leading cause of death in the United States (US). Since 1950, non-Hispanic blacks (NHB) have experienced higher rates of mortality than non-Hispanic whites (NHW). Previous studies revealed geographic variation in mortality rates by race. The identification of areas with the greatest disparity in influenza and pneumonia mortality may assist policy makers in the allocation of resources including for the COVID-19 pandemic. Research question: Does geographic variation in racial disparity in influenza and pneumonia mortality exist? Study design: and Methods: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) database for multiple cause of death between 1999-2018 for NHB and NHW decedents aged â‰¥ 25 years with an ICD-10 code for influenza (J09-J11) and pneumonia (J12-J18) was used. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI)were computed by race for Health &amp; Human Services (HHS) regions and urbanization in non-Hispanics RESULTS: In 1999-2018, there were 540,476 deaths among NHB and NHW aged 25-84 years. AAMR was higher in NHB than NHW in each age group and in 7 of 10 HHS regions. The greatest disparity was in HHS regions 2 (NY, NJ) and 9 (Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada). In HHS region 2, NHB [24.6 (95% CI 24.1-25.1)] were more likely to die than NHW [15.7 (95% CI 15.6-15.9)]. Similarly, in region 9, NHB [23.2 (95% CI 22.7-23.8)] had higher mortality than NHW [16.1 (95% CI 15.9-16.2)]. Within these regions, disparities were greatest in the core of major metropolitan areas. Much of the disparity was due to very high mortality rates in NHB in these areas: region 2 large central metro areas NHB 28.2 (95% CI 27.6-28.9). Interpretation: In 1999-2018 the NHB-NHW disparity in AAMR from influenza and pneumonia was greatest in central metro areas of HHS regions 2 and 9.</Abstract>

        <Title>Preparing for the COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Impact on a Nursing Simulation Curriculum Preparing for the COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Impact on a Nursing Simulation Curriculum</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: This article describes one school's process to maintain their undergraduate nursing simulation program during campus closure and clinical placement suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: After the campus closure, faculty replaced clinical hours with simulation using virtual clinical education such as telehealth with standardized patients (SPs), virtual simulations using commercial products, and virtual faculty skills instruction. Results: Using virtual clinical education and SP-based telehealth simulations provided an alternative for 50% of the required direct patient care hours. Virtual simulation accounted for 18,403 clinical hours completed by 244 students. Conclusion: Preparation for emergencies that force campus and clinical site closures should include processes to provide virtual simulation and remote simulations with SPs to replace clinical hours. Planning for the impacts of COVID-19 on the operation of this school of nursing highlights the importance of having a detailed plan to address campus closure due to emergencies.

        <Abstract>Background: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted all aspects of health care, including nursing education. Senior nursing students saw the elimination of in-person clinical opportunities in the final months prior to graduation as health care facilities restricted access to essential personnel in an effort to minimize transmission of the virus and conserve personal protective equipment. Method: To fulfill course requirements, faculty created a COVID-19 assignment that implored students to research the most current infection control recommendations for COVID-19 and to describe the impacts of the virus on nursing care, patients, families, interdisciplinary collaboration, and public safety. Results: The COVID-19 assignment fostered clinical reasoning and encouraged personal reflection with application to practice. Students reported that the assignment greatly enhanced knowledge and awareness of COVID-19. Conclusion: This assignment was beneficial for transition to practice in the midst of a pandemic, and it can be easily replicated for any future emerging health care topic that may affect nursing education.

        <Abstract>We analyzed 21,676 residual specimens from Ontario, Canada collected between March-August, 2020 to investigate the effect of antibody decline on SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence estimates. Testing specimens orthogonally using the Abbott (anti-nucleocapsid) and then the Ortho (anti-spike) assays, seroprevalence estimates ranged from 0.4%-1.4%, despite ongoing disease activity. The geometric mean concentration (GMC) of antibody-positive specimens decreased over time (p=0.015), and the GMC of antibody-negative specimens increased over time (p=0.0018). The association between the two tests decreased each month (p&lt;0.001), suggesting anti-N antibody decline. Lowering the Abbott antibody index cut-off from 1.4 to 0.7 resulted in a 16% increase in positive specimens.</Abstract>

        <Title>The duration, dynamics and determinants of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in individual healthcare workers The duration, dynamics and determinants of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in individual healthcare workers</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody measurements can be used to estimate the proportion of a population exposed or infected and may be informative about the risk of future infection. Previous estimates of the duration of antibody responses vary. Methods: We present 6 months of data from a longitudinal seroprevalence study of 3276 UK healthcare workers (HCWs). Serial measurements of SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid and anti-spike IgG were obtained. Interval censored survival analysis was used to investigate the duration of detectable responses. Additionally, Bayesian mixed linear models were used to investigate anti-nucleocapsid waning. Results: Anti-spike IgG levels remained stably detected after a positive result, e.g., in 94% (95% credibility interval, CrI, 91-96%) of HCWs at 180 days. Anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels rose to a peak at 24 (95% credibility interval, CrI 19-31) days post first PCR-positive test, before beginning to fall. Considering 452 anti-nucleocapsid seropositive HCWs over a median of 121 days from their maximum positive IgG titre, the mean estimated antibody half-life was 85 (95%CrI, 81-90) days. Higher maximum observed anti-nucleocapsid titres were associated with longer estimated antibody half-lives. Increasing age, Asian ethnicity and prior self-reported symptoms were independently associated with higher maximum anti-nucleocapsid levels and increasing age and a positive PCR test undertaken for symptoms with longer anti-nucleocapsid half-lives. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid antibodies wane within months, and faster in younger adults and those without symptoms. However, anti-spike IgG remains stably detected. Ongoing longitudinal studies are required to track the long-term duration of antibody levels and their association with immunity to SARS-CoV-2 reinfection.</Abstract>

        <Title>Venous thromboembolism and major bleeding in patients with COVID-19: A nationwide population-based cohort study Venous thromboembolism and major bleeding in patients with COVID-19: A nationwide population-based cohort study</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a potentially fatal complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection and thromboprophylaxis should be balanced against risk of bleeding. This study aimed to examine risks of VTE and major bleeding in hospitalized and community-managed SARS-CoV-2 patients compared with control populations. Methods: Using nationwide population-based registries, 30-day risks of VTE and major bleeding in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were compared with those of SARS-CoV-2 test-negative patients and with an external cohort of influenza patients. Medical records of all COVID-19 patients at six departments of infectious diseases in Denmark were reviewed in detail. Results: The overall 30-day risk of VTE was 0.4% (40/9,460) among SARS-CoV-2 patients (16% hospitalized), 0.3% (649/226,510) among SARS-CoV-2 negative subjects (12% hospitalized), and 1.0% (158/16,281) among influenza patients (59% hospitalized). VTE risks were higher and comparable in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive (1.5%), SARS-CoV-2 negative (1.8%), and influenza patients (1.5%). Diagnosis of major bleeding was registered in 0.5% (47/9,460) of all SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals and in 2.3% of those hospitalized. Medical record review of 582 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients observed VTE in 4% (19/450) and major bleeding in 0.4% (2/450) of ward patients, of whom 31% received thromboprophylaxis. Among intensive care patients (100% received thromboprophylaxis), risks were 7% (9/132) for VTE and 11% (15/132) for major bleeding. Conclusions: Among people with SARS-CoV-2 infection in a population-based setting, VTE risks were low to moderate and were not substantially increased compared with SARS-CoV-2 test-negative and influenza patients. Risk of severe bleeding was low for ward patients, but mirrored VTE risk in the intensive care setting.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Introduction: While chest x-rays (CXRs) represent a cost-effective imaging modality for developing countries like Pakistan, their utility for the prognostication of COVID-19 has been minimally explored. Thus, we describe the frequency and distribution of CXR findings, and their association with clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Methods: All adult (â‰¥ 18 years) patients presenting between 28th February-31st May to the emergency department of a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan, who were COVID-19 positive on RT-PCR with CXR done on presentation, were included. A CXR Severity Score (CXR-SS) of 0-8 was used to quantify the extent of pulmonary infection on CXR, with a score of 0 being negative and 1-8 being positive. The patients' initial CXR-SS and their highest CXR-SS over the hospital course were used for analysis, with cut-offs of 0-4 and 5-8 being used to assess association with clinical outcomes. Results: A total of 150 patients, with 76.7% males and mean age 56.1 years, were included in this study. Initial CXR was positive in 80% of patients, and 30.7% of patients had an initial CXR-SS between 5-8. The mortality rate was 16.7% and 30.6% patients underwent ICU admission with intubation (ICU-Int). On multivariable analysis, initial CXR-SS (1.355 [1.136-1.616]) and highest CXR-SS (1.390 [1.143-1.690]) were predictors of ICU-Int, and ICU-Int was independently associated with both initial CXR-SS 5-8 (2.532 [1.109-5.782]) and highest CXR-SS 5-8 (3.386 [1.405-8.159]). Lastly, age (1.060 [1.009-1.113]), initial CXR-SS (1.278 [1.010-1.617]) and ICU-Int (5.047 [1.731-14.710]), were found to be independent predictors of mortality in our patients. Conclusion: In a resource-constrained country like Pakistan, CXRs may have valuable prognostic utility in predicting ICU admission and mortality. Additional research with larger patient samples is needed to further explore the association of CXR findings with clinical outcomes.</Abstract>

        <Title>Knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19 among Palestinians during the COVID-19 outbreak: A cross-sectional survey Knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19 among Palestinians during the COVID-19 outbreak: A cross-sectional survey</Title>
        <Abstract>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious illness that spreads rapidly through human-to-human transmission. On March 5, the government of Palestine declared a state of emergency in order to curb the spread of the virus, a declaration that it extended for a fifth time on July 5th. The degree to which a population complies with corresponding safety measures is surely affected by the people's knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards the disease. To explore this hypothesis, we gathered data from 1,731 Palestinians between April 19thand May 1st, 2020 through a KAP questionnaire. The participant pool represented a stratified sample of Palestinians living across a number of governorates in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, with 36.5% from Gaza and (63.5%) from the West Bank. Gender was almost equally distributed within the sample with (51%) men respondents and (49%) women respondent. The questionnaire included 17 questions about participants' knowledge and awareness of COVID-19, 17 questions regarding the safety measures they had taken in the wake of the outbreak and 3 questions asking them to assess the efficacy of the government's response to the pandemic. Our data shows that 79% of the respondents have good awareness about transmission of the virus, 55.6% were knowledgeable of the symptoms exhibited by an infected individual, 81% were aware of the preventative measures and 82% demonstrated awareness of the risk groups. Most participants complied with preventative measures (77%) and 62% the study participants agreed that stricter measures have to be enforced by the government to limit the spread of the virus. Our study revealed that younger participants and people with higher educational level demonstrated more awareness of the virus. Also, Women were reported to be more aware of preventative measures and to have complied more with good practices. We report that residents of the West Bank have complied more with the right practices when compared to residents of Gaza. Based on the results of this study, we conclude that health education programs aimed at improving the public's understanding of COVID-19 are important in helping the population maintain appropriate practices and should be target people with lower educational level, and that findings such as those discussed in this report may provide valuable feedback to lawmakers working to stop the spread of the virus.</Abstract>

        <Title>The chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury involvement in COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis The chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury involvement in COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: Currently, the SARS-CoV-2 promptly spread across China and around the world. However, there are controversies about whether preexisting chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney injury complication (AKI) are involved in the COVID-19 pandemic. Measurements: Studies reported the kidney outcomes in different severity of COVID-19 were included in this study. Standardized mean differences or odds ratios were calculated by employing Review Manager meta-analysis software. Results: Thirty-six trials were included in this systematic review with a total of 6395 COVID-19 patients. The overall effects indicated that preexisting CKD (OR = 3.28), complication of AKI (OR = 11.02), serum creatinine (SMD = 0.68), abnormal serum creatinine (OR = 4.86), blood urea nitrogen (SMD = 1.95), abnormal blood urea nitrogen (OR = 6.53), received continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) (OR = 23.63) were significantly increased in severe group than that in nonsevere group. Additionally, the complication of AKI (OR = 13.92) and blood urea nitrogen (SMD = 1.18) were remarkably elevated in the critical group than that in the severe group. Conclusions: CKD and AKI are susceptible to occur in patients with severe COVID-19. CRRT is applied frequently in severe COVID-19 patients than that in nonsevere COVID-19 patients. The risk of AKI is higher in the critical group than that in the severe group.</Abstract>

        <Title>What have we learned about positive changes experienced during COVID-19 lockdown? Evidence of the social patterning of change What have we learned about positive changes experienced during COVID-19 lockdown? Evidence of the social patterning of change</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: Multiple studies have highlighted the negative impact of COVID-19 and its particular effects on vulnerable sub-populations. Complementing this work, here, we report on the social patterning of self-reported positive changes experienced during COVID-19 national lockdown in Scotland. Methods: The CATALYST study collected data from 3342 adults in Scotland during weeks 9-12 of a national lockdown. Using a cross-sectional design, participants completed an online questionnaire providing data on key sociodemographic and health variables, and completed a measure of positive change. The positive change measure spanned diverse domains (e.g., more quality time with family, developing new hobbies, more physical activity, and better quality of sleep). We used univariate analysis and stepwise regression to examine the contribution of a range of sociodemographic factors (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, educational attainment, and employment status) in explaining positive change. Results: There were clear sociodemographic differences across positive change scores. Those reporting higher levels of positive change were female, from younger age groups, married or living with their partner, employed, and in better health. Conclusion: Overall our results highlight the social patterning of positive changes during lockdown in Scotland. These findings begin to illuminate the complexity of the unanticipated effects of national lockdown and will be used to support future intervention development work sharing lessons learned from lockdown to increase positive health change amongst those who may benefit.</Abstract>

        <Title>Population's Knowledge About COVID-19: A Cross-Sectional Web-Based Study in Brazil Population's Knowledge About COVID-19: A Cross-Sectional Web-Based Study in Brazil</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly transmissible illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease has affected more than 200 countries and the measures that have been implemented to combat its spread, as there is still no vaccine or definitive medication, have been based on supportive interventions and drug repositioning. Brazil, the largest country in South America, has had more than 140,000 recorded deaths and is one of the most affected countries. Despite the extensive quantity of scientifically recognized information, there are still conflicting discussions on how best to face the disease and the virus, especially with regard to social distancing, preventive methods, and the use of medications. Objective: Thus, the main purpose of this work was to evaluate the Brazilian population's basic knowledge about COVID-19 to demonstrate how Brazilians are managing to identify only scientifically proven information. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used. An original online questionnaire survey was administered from June 16 to August 21, 2020 across all five different geopolitical regions of the country (i.e., the North, Northeast, Center-West, Southeast, and South). The questionnaire was comprised of questions about basic aspects of COVID-19, such as the related symptoms, conduct that should be followed when suspected of infection, risk groups, prevention, transmission, and social distancing. The wrong questionnaire response alternatives were taken from the fake news combat website of Brazilian Ministry of Health. Participants (aged â‰¥18 years) were recruited through social network platforms including Facebook, WhatsApp, and Twitter. The mean distribution, frequencies and (dis) similarity between the responses for the different variables of the study were evaluated. Significance levels in all statistical tests were less than 0.05. Results: A total of 4,180 valid responses representative of all the states and regions of Brazil were recorded. Most respondents had good knowledge about COVID-19, getting an average of 86.59% of the total score, with regard to the basic aspects of the disease. Region, educational level, age, sex, and social condition had a significant association (p &lt; 0.0001) with knowledge about the disease, which meant that women, the young, those with higher educational levels, non-recipients of social assistance, and more economically and socially developed regions had more correct answers. Conclusions: Overall, Brazilians with social media access can be said to have a good level of basic knowledge about COVID-19, but with differences depending on the analyzed subgroup. Due to the limitation of the platform used in carrying out the study, care should be taken when generalizing the study findings to populations unschooled or who are not used to accessing social network platforms.</Abstract>

        <Title>Giving Your EHR a Checkup after COVID-19: A Practical Framework for Reviewing Clinical Decision Support in Light of the Telemedicine Expansion Giving Your EHR a Checkup after COVID-19: A Practical Framework for Reviewing Clinical Decision Support in Light of the Telemedicine Expansion</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: The transformation of healthcare during COVID-19 with the rapid expansion of telemedicine visits presents new challenges to chronic care and preventive health providers. Clinical decision support (CDS) is critically important to chronic care providers, and CDS malfunction is common during times of change. It is essential to regularly re-assess an organization's ambulatory CDS program to maintain care quality. This is especially true after an immense change, like the COVID-19 telemedicine expansion. Objective: Our objective is to re-assess the ambulatory CDS program at a large academic medical center in light of telemedicine's expansion in response to COVID-19. Methods: Our clinical informatics team devised a practical framework for an intra-pandemic ambulatory CDS assessment focused on the impact of the telemedicine expansion. This assessment began with a quantitative analysis comparing CDS alert performance in the context of in-person and telemedicine visits. Board-certified physician informaticists then completed a formal workflow review of alerts with inferior performance in telemedicine visits. Informaticists then reported on themes and optimization opportunities through the existing CDS governance structure. Results: Our assessment revealed that 10 of our top 40 alerts by volume were not firing as expected in telemedicine visits. In 3 out of the top 5 alerts, providers were significantly less likely to take action in telemedicine when compared to office visits. Cumulatively, alerts in telemedicine encounters had an action taken rate of 5.3% (3,257/64,938) compared to 8.3% (19,427/233,636) for office visits. Observations from a clinical informaticist workflow review included: (1) Telemedicine visits have different workflows than office visits. Some alerts developed for the office were not appearing at the optimal time in the telemedicine workflow. (2) Missing clinical data is a common reason for decreased alert firing seen in telemedicine visits. (3) Remote patient monitoring and patient-reported clinical data entered through the portal could replace data collection usually completed in the office by an MA or RN. Conclusions: In a large academic medical center at the pandemic epicenter, an intra-pandemic ambulatory CDS assessment revealed clinically significant CDS malfunctions that highlight the importance of re-assessing ambulatory CDS performance after the telemedicine expansion.</Abstract>

        <Title>Unfolding determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in China Unfolding determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in China</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: China is at the forefront of global efforts to develop COVID-19 vaccines and has five fast-tracked candidates in the final-stage, large scale human clinical trials tests. Layered on top of public engagement, making an informed and judicious choice is a dilemma for the Chinese government in the context of COVID-19 vaccination promotion. Objective: In this study, public opinions in China are analyzed via public dialogues on Chinese social media, based on which the views on COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination of Chinese netizens are investigated. We recommend strategies for promoting vaccination programs in the most populous country based on an in-depth understanding of the challenges in risk communication and social mobilizations. Methods: We proposed a novel behavioral dynamics model SRS/I to analyze the opinion transmission paradigms on Chinese social media. Coupled with meta-analysis and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the emotion polarity of individual opinion is examined in contexts. Results: We collected more than 1.75 million Weibo messages about COVID-19 vaccines from January to October in 2020. According to the public opinion reproduction ratio (R_0), the dynamic propagation of those messages can be classified into three-stage: the Ferment period (R_0,1.1360), the Evolution period (R_0, 2.8278) and the Transmission period (R_0, 3.0729). Significantly, the topics on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in China are emerging from the landscape of public opinion transmissions, such as price, side effects, and the like. From September to October, the Weibos claimed that the vaccine was overpriced, occupied 18.3%, and received 38.1% Likes in Weibo's relevant topics. On the contrary, the number of Weibos which considered the vaccine reasonably priced is twice that of the former, but it received less amount of Likes, accounting for 25.0%. The emotional polarity of netizens in terms of side effects is another aspect of our research. We obtained 47.7% positive and 31.9% negative Weibos about side effects, respectively. One intriguing phenomenon we also captured in this research is that the inactivated vaccines aroused much more heated discussion than any other vaccine type. The Discussions, Forwards, Comments, and Likes from the topics of inactivated vaccines respectively account for 53%, 42%, 56%, and 49% of those from the five types of vaccine development in China. Conclusions: Most Chinese believe that the vaccine is cheaper than previously thought, while some claim they could not afford it for their entire family. The Chinese are inclined to be positive to side effects over time and proud of China's development regarding vaccines. Nevertheless, they have a collective misunderstanding about inactivated vaccines, insisting that inactivated vaccines are safer than other vaccines. Reflecting on those collective responses, the unfolding determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance provide illuminating benchmarks for vaccine-promoting policy-makings.</Abstract>

        <Title>Covid-19-induced "fear" in infoveillance studies: a pilot analysis of preliminary results Covid-19-induced "fear" in infoveillance studies: a pilot analysis of preliminary results</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: The World Health Organization named the phenomenon of misinformation spread through the social media "infodemics", and recognized the need to curb it. Misinformation infodemics undermine not only population safety, but also compliance to the suggestions/prophylactic measures recommended in pandemics. Objective: The aim of this pilot study was to review the impact of social media on general population "fear" in "infoveillance" studies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: PRISMA protocol was followed and six out of twenty studies were retrieved, meta-analyzed, and had their findings presented in the form of a Forest plot. Results: The summary random and significant event rate was 0.298, 95% CI respectively 0.213 and 0.400, suggesting that social media-circulated misinformation related to COVID-19 triggered public fear and other psychological manifestations. These findings merit special attention by public health authorities. Conclusions: Thus, "infodemiology" and Infoveillance are valid tools in the hands of epidemiologists to help prevent dissemination of false information with potentially damaging effects.</Abstract>

        <Title>Implementation of Telemedicine in a Tertiary Hospital-Based Ambulatory Practice in Detroit During the COVID-19 Pandemic Implementation of Telemedicine in a Tertiary Hospital-Based Ambulatory Practice in Detroit During the COVID-19 Pandemic</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has forced the health care delivery structure to change rapidly. The pandemic has further widened the disparities in health care and exposed vulnerable populations. Health care services caring for such populations must not only continue to operate but create innovative methods of care delivery without compromising safety. We present our experience of incorporating telemedicine in our busy university hospital-based outpatient clinic in one of the worst-hit areas in the world. Objective: Our goal was to assess the adoption of telemedicine service in the first month of its implementation in outpatient practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also wanted to assess the need for transitioning to telemedicine, the benefits and challenges in doing so, and ongoing solutions during the initial phase of the implementation of telemedicine services for our patients. Methods: We conducted a prospective review of clinic operations data from the first month of telemedicine rollout in the outpatient adult ambulatory clinic from April 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020. A telemedicine visit was defined as synchronous audio-video communication between the provider and patient for clinical care longer than 5 minutes or video visit converted to telephone visit after 5 minutes due to technical problems. We recorded the number of telemedicine visits scheduled, visits completed and the time for each visit. We also noted the most frequent billing codes used based on the time spent in the patient care and the number of clinical tasks (e.g activity suggested through diagnosis or procedural code) which were addressed remotely by the physicians. Results: During the study period, we had 110 telemedicine visits scheduled, of which 94 visits (85.4%) were completed. The average duration of the video visit was 35 minutes, with the most prolonged visit lasting 120 minutes. Of 94 patients, 24 patients (25.54%) were recently discharged from hospital, and 70 patients (74.46 %) were seen for urgent care needs. There was 50 % increase from the baseline in the number of clinical tasks which were addressed by the physicians during the pandemic. Conclusions: There was high acceptance of telemedicine services by the patients, which was evident by a high show rate during the COVID-19 pandemic in Detroit. With limited staffing, restricted outpatient work hours, a shortage of providers, and increased outpatient needs, telemedicine was successfully implemented in our practice.</Abstract>

        <Title>Federated Learning of Electronic Health Records Improves Mortality Prediction in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19 Federated Learning of Electronic Health Records Improves Mortality Prediction in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: Machine learning (ML) models require large datasets which may be siloed across different healthcare institutions. Current ML studies focusing on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are limited to single hospital data which limits model generalizability. Objective: Using federated learning, a ML technique that avoids locally aggregating raw clinical data across multiple institutions, we predict mortality within seven days in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: Patient data was collected from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) from five hospitals within the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS). Logistic Regression with L1 regularization (LASSO) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models were trained using local data at each site, a pooled model with combined data from all five sites, and a federated model that only shared parameters with a central aggregator. Results: LASSO-federated outperformed LASSO-local at three hospitals, and MLP-federated performed better than MLP-local at all five hospitals as measured by area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUC-ROC). LASSO-pooled outperformed LASSO-federated at all hospitals, and MLP-federated outperformed MLP-pooled at two hospitals. Conclusions: Federated learning shows promise in COVID-19 EHR data to develop robust predictive models without compromising patient privacy.</Abstract>

        <Title>A name-based mask rationing plan in Taiwan may contribute to reduced public anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic: an observational study A name-based mask rationing plan in Taiwan may contribute to reduced public anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic: an observational study</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: The emerging COVID-19 is a severe health crisis worldwide. Wearing a mask was straightforward but shortage of stock and equity of allocation were important issues in Taiwan. Furthermore, increased anxiety leading to stockpiling of masks is common during the pandemic. Objective: We aimed to summarize the name-based mask rationing plan implemented in Taiwan and explore the perceived anxiety of mask shortage. Methods: The government of Taiwan took action to control the supply and allocation of facemasks. We summarize the timeline and important components of mask rationing plan. A simple survey with a 5-point scale questionnaire that aimed to investigate the overall responses to the mask rationing plan was conducted to 44 participants. Results: The mask rationing plan was implemented since late January 2020 and the daily production capacity increased from 2 millions masks to 16 millions in April 2020. People could buy 9 masks in 14 days by verification of national health insurance card. Software applications of face mask availability was demonstrated. Moreover, the mask plan safeguarded the purchase of masks and could result in a decrease in anxiety of mask shortage (4.05 Â± 1.15 points, agree or strongly agree: 72.7% participants). And the majority of people felt that the mask plan was satisfactory (4.2Â±0.92 points, agree or strongly agree: 79.5%). Conclusions: We found the unique name-based mask rationing plan could control the production, supply of masks, and contribute to the appropriate allocation of masks. It may not only provide physical barriers, but also result in a reduction in the anxiety of mask shortage during the pandemic.</Abstract>
