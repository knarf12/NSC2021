        <Abstract>The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is now officially declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. As of now, there is no known effective pharmaceutical agent against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, several precautionary measures have been prescribed to prevent further spread of the virus, which include avoidance of social gatherings, proper handwashing, frequently disinfecting of used items and surfaces and so on. More recent studies have highlighted the possibility of treating patients infected with the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, of which mechanism of action is not completely understood. We seek to draw the attention of the scientific community to the possibility of drastically reducing the effects of the virus on the affected patients and improving clinical trials outcome through the synergistic action of zinc and chloroquine in patients suffering from the coronavirus disease.
