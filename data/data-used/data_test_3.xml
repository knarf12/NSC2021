        <Title>[Serum C-reactive protein, cholinesterase and prealbumin are correlated with prognosis of severe coronavirus disease 2019 patients] [Serum C-reactive protein, cholinesterase and prealbumin are correlated with prognosis of severe coronavirus disease 2019 patients]</Title>
        <Abstract>Objective: To retrospectively analyze the relationship between serum C-reactive protein (CRP), serum cholinesterase (ChE), prealbumin (PA) and mortality in severe patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: During the period from January 29 to March 30, 2020, a total of 344 COVID-19 patients were admitted to west branch of Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. One-hundred and ninety-two patients were diagnosed with common type and excluded, and 34 patients were transferred to LeiShenShan or other medical units. The remaining 118 patients were severe cases, and 18 cases were excluded due to incomplete data. A total of 100 severe COVID-19 patients were finally collected. According to the outcome, the patients were divided into death group (37 cases) and survival group(63 cases), and the levels of serum CRP, ChE and PA were compared. Statistical analysis were performed by SPSS25.0. Results: There were 53 male patients in this study. The level of CRP in death group was significantly more elevated compare to the survival group [(95.72±39.56) mg/L vs. (22.21±20.75) mg/L, P&lt;0.01]. On the contrary, serum ChE in death group was remarkably decreased [(5 082±1 566) U/L vs. (7 075±1 680) U/L, P&lt;0.01]. Also, serum PA in death group was significantly lower [(86.18±47.94) mg/L vs. (167.40±57.82) mg/L, P&lt;0.01]. Univariate analysis showed that CRP and PA had an impact on the survival of critical patients, but multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that CRP was the independent factor affecting the survival of critical patients. Conclusions: CRP is generally elevated in severe patients with COVID-19, and serum ChE and PA accordingly decrease. CRP and PA have influence on patients' survival, but only CRP demonstrates predictive value for prognosis in critical patients with COVID-19.</Abstract>

        <Title>Distressing healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: the challenges of holiday season in the Philippines Distressing healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: the challenges of holiday season in the Philippines</Title>
        <Abstract>The holiday season, Christmas to New Year, is the most festive period of each year in the Philippines. However, the beginning of the festive holiday season in the Philippines seems to be a predicament to healthcare workers and professionals especially during this coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The holiday season is considered a health risk in the Philippines because of the change of lifestyle leading to the increased number of health consultancies and hospitalization. Thus, the expected surge of people in the hospitals and clinics pose an added stress to healthcare workers and professionals. Pre-Holiday policies and programs are therefore essentials especially during the course of battling COVID-19.</Abstract>

        <Title>The impact of COVID-19 infection on the cytokine profile of pregnant women: A prospective case-control study The impact of COVID-19 infection on the cytokine profile of pregnant women: A prospective case-control study</Title>
        <Abstract>Objective: To compare the levels of various cytokines between pregnant women with confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection and pregnant women without any defined risk factor. Materials and methods: Pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 infection (study group)(n = 90) were prospectively compared to a gestational age-matched control group of pregnant women without any defined risk factors (n = 90). Demographic features, clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, interferon-gamma (IFN γ), interleukin (IL-2), IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17 levels were compared between the groups. Additionally, a correlation analysis was performed in the study group for the assessment of IFN γ, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17 levels with disease severity and CRP levels. Results: Study group had significantly higher pregnancy complication rate, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, IFN γ, and IL-6 values (p &lt; 0.05). On the other hand, the control group had significantly higher hemoglobin, leukocyte, platelet, lymphocyte, IL-2, IL-10, and IL-17 values (p &lt; 0.05). Statistically significant differences were found between the groups for IFN γ, IL-2, IL-10, and IL-17 values between the trimesters (p &lt; 0.05). Statistically significant positive correlations were found for IFN γ and IL-6 with disease severity (r = 0.41 and p &lt; 0.001 for IFN γ and r = 0.58 and p &lt; 0.001 for IL-6). On the other hand, a moderate negative correlation for IL-2 and a weak negative correlation for IL-10 were present (r = -0.62 and p &lt; 0.001 for IL-2 and r = -0.19 and p = 0.01 for IL-10). A statistically significant positive moderate correlation was found between IL-6 and CRP (r = 0.40 and p &lt; 0.001) CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection seems to have an impact on the cytokine profile of pregnant women varying according to pregnancy trimesters and cytokine levels seem to be correlated with disease severity.</Abstract>

        <Title>Stable dechlorination of Trichloroacetic Acid (TCAA) to acetic acid catalyzed by palladium nanoparticles deposited on H 2-transfer membranes Stable dechlorination of Trichloroacetic Acid (TCAA) to acetic acid catalyzed by palladium nanoparticles deposited on H 2-transfer membranes</Title>
        <Abstract>Trichloroacetic acid (TCAA) is a common disinfection byproduct (DBP) produced during chlorine disinfection. With the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the use of chlorine disinfection has increased, raising the already substantial risks of DBP exposure. While a number of methods are able to remove TCAA, their application for continuous treatment is limited due to their complexity and expensive or hazardous inputs. We investigated a novel system that employs palladium (Pd0) nanoparticles (PdNPs) for catalytic reductive dechlorination of TCAA. H2 was delivered directly to PdNPs in situ coated on the surface of bubble-free hollow-fiber gas-transfer membranes. The H2-based membrane Pd film reactor (H2-MPfR) achieved a high catalyst-specific TCAA reduction rate, 32 L/g-Pd/min, a value similar to the rate of using homogeneously suspended PdNP, but orders of magnitude higher than with other immobilized PdNP systems. In batch tests, over 99% removal of 1 mM TCAA was achieved in 180 min with strong product selectivity (≥ 93%) to acetic acid. During 50 days of continuous operation, over 99% of 1 mg/L influent TCAA was removed, again with acetic acid as the major product (≥ 94%). We identified the reaction pathways and their kinetics for TCAA reductive dechlorination with PdNPs using direct delivery of H2. Sustained continuous TCAA removal, high selectivity to acetic acid, and minimal loss of PdNPs support that the H2-MPfR is a promising catalytic reactor to remove chlorinated DBPs in practice.</Abstract>

        <Title>Systemic thrombosis in a large cohort of COVID-19 patients despite thromboprophylaxis: A retrospective study Systemic thrombosis in a large cohort of COVID-19 patients despite thromboprophylaxis: A retrospective study</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: Incidence of thrombotic events associated to Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is difficult to assess and reported rates differ significantly. Optimal thromboprophylaxis is unclear. Objectives: We aimed to analyze the characteristics of patients with a confirmed thrombotic complication including inflammatory and hemostatic parameters, compare patients affected by arterial vs venous events and examine differences between survivors and non-survivors. We reviewed compliance with thromboprophylaxis and explored how the implementation of a severity-adjusted protocol could have influenced outcome. Methods: Single-cohort retrospective study of COVID-19 patients admitted, from March 3 to May 3 2020, to the Infanta Leonor University Hospital in Madrid, epicenter of the Spanish outbreak. Results: Among 1127 patients, 80 thrombotic events were diagnosed in 69 patients (6.1% of the entire cohort). Forty-three patients (62%) suffered venous thromboembolism, 18 (26%) arterial episodes and 6 (9%) concurrent venous and arterial thrombosis. Most patients (90%) with a confirmed thrombotic complication where under low-molecular-weight heparin treatment. Overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was rare. Initial ISTH DIC score and pre-event CRP were significantly higher among non-survivors. In multivariate analysis, arterial localization was an independent predictor of mortality (OR = 18, 95% CI: 2.4-142, p &lt; .05). Conclusions: Despite quasi-universal thromboprophylaxis, COVID-19 lead to a myriad of arterial and venous thrombotic events. Considering the subgroup of patients with thrombotic episodes, arterial events appeared earlier in the course of disease and conferred very poor prognosis, and an ISTH DIC score ≥ 3 at presentation was identified as a potential predictor of mortality. Severity-adjusted thromboprophylaxis seemed to decrease the number of events and could have influenced mortality. Randomized controlled trials are eagerly awaited.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan in December 2019 and has spread globally. Studies have shown that smokers are less likely to be diagnosed with or be hospitalized for COVID-19 but, once hospitalized, have higher odds for an adverse outcome. We have previously presented the potential interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), due to a "toxin-like" epitope on the Spike glycoprotein, with homology to a sequence of a snake venom toxin. This epitope coincides with the well-described cryptic epitope for the human anti-SARS-CoV antibody CR3022. In this study, we present the molecular complexes of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins, at their open or closed conformations, with the model of the human α7 nAChR. We found that all studied protein complexes' interface involves a large part of the "toxin-like" sequences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins and toxin binding site of human α7 nAChR. Our findings provide further support to the hypothesis about the protective role of nicotine and other cholinergic agonists. The potential therapeutic role of CR3022 and other similar monoclonal antibodies with increased affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein against the clinical effects originating from the dysregulated cholinergic pathway should be further explored.</Abstract>

        <Title>The immunodominant and neutralization linear epitopes for SARS-CoV-2 The immunodominant and neutralization linear epitopes for SARS-CoV-2</Title>
        <Abstract>Although vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are under development, the antigen epitopes on the virus and their immunogenicity are poorly understood. Here, we simulate the 3D structures and predict the B cell epitopes on the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using structure-based approaches and validate epitope immunogenicity by immunizing mice. Almost all 33 predicted epitopes effectively induce antibody production, six of these are immunodominant epitopes in individuals, and 23 are conserved within SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and bat coronavirus RaTG13. We find that the immunodominant epitopes of individuals with domestic (China) SARS-CoV-2 are different from those of individuals with imported (Europe) SARS-CoV-2, which may be caused by mutations on the S (G614D) and N proteins. Importantly, we find several epitopes on the S protein that elicit neutralizing antibodies against D614 and G614 SARS-CoV-2, which can contribute to vaccine design against coronaviruses.</Abstract>

        <Title>Stabilizing and Strengthening the Affordable Care Act: Opportunities for a New Administration Stabilizing and Strengthening the Affordable Care Act: Opportunities for a New Administration</Title>
        <Abstract>Over the past decade, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has successfully reduced uninsurance and improved access to and affordability of health care services for millions of Americans. But the law has been weakened over the past four years as the Trump administration shortened the open enrollment period in the federal Marketplace, reduced outreach and enrollment funding, and revised the public charge rule, among other actions. The incoming Biden administration will have the chance to reverse some of these changes and further strengthen the law to improve health care access and affordability. In this paper, I explore options to expand access to affordable coverage and care for those who do not qualify for Medicaid or Marketplace financial assistance, and further discuss opportunities to increase enrollment among those who are already eligible. I also examine opportunities to expand access to specific services, including reproductive health care, among those with insurance. Any attempts to modify or build upon the ACA will likely be complicated by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic as well as a divided Congress, but regulatory solutions will likely be easier to achieve than those that require changes to federal law or state policy.</Abstract>

        <Title>First report on prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among health-care workers in Nicaragua First report on prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among health-care workers in Nicaragua</Title>
        <Abstract>The Nicaraguan COVID-19 situation is exceptional for Central America. The government restricts testing and testing supplies, and the true extent of the coronavirus crisis remains unknown. Dozens of deaths have been reported among health-care workers. However, statistics on the crisis' effect on health-care workers and their risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 are lacking. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health-care workers and to examine correlations with risk factors such as age, sex and comorbidities. Study participants (N = 402, median age 38.48 years) included physicians, nurses and medical assistants, from public and private hospitals, independent of symptom presentation. SARS-CoV-2 was detected on saliva samples using the loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay. A questionnaire was employed to determine subjects' COVID-19-associated symptoms and their vulnerability to complications from risk factors such as age, sex, professional role and comorbidities. The study was performed five weeks into the exponential growth period in Nicaragua. We discovered that 30.35% of health-care workers participating in our study had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. A large percentage (54.92%) of those who tested positive were asymptomatic and were still treating patients. Nearly 50% of health-care workers who tested positive were under 40, an astonishing 30.33% reported having at least one comorbidity. In our study, sex and age are important risk factors for the probability of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with significance being greatest among those between 30 and 40 years of age. In general, being male resulted in higher risk. Our data are the first non-governmental data obtained in Nicaragua. They shed light on several important aspects of COVID-19 in an underdeveloped nation whose government has implemented a herd-immunity strategy, while lacking an adequate healthcare system and sufficient PPE for health-care workers. These data are important for creating policies for containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.</Abstract>

        <Title>Early Perceptions of COVID-19 Contact Tracing Apps in German-speaking Countries: A Comparative Mixed Methods Study Early Perceptions of COVID-19 Contact Tracing Apps in German-speaking Countries: A Comparative Mixed Methods Study</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: The main German-speaking countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) have implemented digital contact tracing apps to assist the authorities' COVID-19 containment strategies. Low user rates can impact contact tracing and thus the ability to control the spread of the novel coronavirus. Objective: This study aims to examine the early perceptions of people living in the German-speaking area and compare them with frames as portrayed by newspapers during the first pandemic wave. Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted with 159 participants in the SolPan project. A total of 110 participants discussed contact tracing applications and were included in this study. Articles regarding contact tracing applications from 12 newspapers in the German-speaking area were analyzed. Results: Interview participants and newspaper coverage in all German-speaking countries perceived and framed contact tracing apps as governmental surveillance tools and embedded them in a broader context of technological surveillance. Participants identified trust in authorities, respect of individual privacy, voluntariness, and temporary use of contact tracing apps as prerequisites for democratic compatibility. Newspaper commonly gave references to the use of such apps in Asian countries, emphasizing the differences in privacy regulation between these countries. Conclusions: The uptake of digital contact tracing apps in German-speaking countries may be undermined due to privacy risks that are not compensated by potential benefits, and that are rooted in a deeper skepticism towards digital tools. When authorities plan on implementing new digital tools and practices in the future, they should be very transparent and proactive in communicating the objectives, the contribution of the technology, and how it differs from other, possibly similar, tools. It is also important to publicly address ethical, legal, and social issues related to such technologies prior to their launch.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has negatively impacted mortality, economic conditions, and mental health and these impacts are likely to continue after the pandemic comes to an end. Objective: At present, no method has characterized the mental health burden of the pandemic distinct from pre-COVID-19 levels. Accurate detection of illness is critical to facilitate pandemic-related treatment to prevent worsening symptoms. Methods: An algorithm for the isolation of pandemic-related concerns on a large digital mental health service is reported that utilized natural language processing (NLP) on unstructured therapy transcript data, in parallel with brief clinical assessments of depression and anxiety symptoms. Results: Results demonstrate a significant increase in COVID-related intake anxiety symptoms, but no detectable difference in intake depression symptoms. Transcript analyses identified terms classifiable into 24 symptoms in excess of those included in the diagnostic criteria for anxiety and depression. Conclusions: Findings for this large digital therapy service suggest that treatment seekers are presenting with more severe intake anxiety levels than before the COVID-19 outbreak. Importantly, monitoring the symptoms identified in the study in addition to those for anxiety and depression is advised to fully capture the effects of COVID-19 on mental health.</Abstract>

        <Title>Soluble ACE2 as a potential therapy for COVID-19 Soluble ACE2 as a potential therapy for COVID-19</Title>
        <Abstract>Soluble angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (sACE2) could be a therapeutic option to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) utilizes ACE2 receptors on cell surfaces to gain intracellular entry making them an ideal target for therapy. High-affinity variants of sACE2, engineered using high-throughput mutagenesis, are capable of neutralizing COVID-19 infection as decoy receptors. These variants compete with native ACE2 present on cells by binding with spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV2, making native ACE2 on cell surfaces available to convert angiotensin-II to angiotensin-1,7, thus alleviating the exaggerated inflammatory response associated with COVID-19 infection. This article explores the use of sACE2 as potential therapy for COVID-19 infection.</Abstract>

        <Title>COVID-19 and Spinal Cord Injury: Clinical Presentation, Clinical Course, and Clinical Outcomes: A Rapid Systematic Review COVID-19 and Spinal Cord Injury: Clinical Presentation, Clinical Course, and Clinical Outcomes: A Rapid Systematic Review</Title>
        <Abstract>Persons living with spinal cord injury (SCI) are potentially at risk for severe COVID-19 disease given that they often have decreased lung capacity and may lack the ability to effectively evacuate their lungs. Known risk factors for negative outcomes after COVID-19, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, disproportionally affect people with SCI and raise concerns for the mortality risk among persons with SCI. A rapid systematic review of English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Chinese literature on COVID-19 and SCI was performed using the keywords "spinal cord injury" and "COVID-19." We included studies that provided information on clinical presentation, characteristics, course, and outcomes of COVID-19 disease in SCI. We excluded studies on patients who did not have an SCI before severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection or did not report clinical information. We included 10 studies in total: nine studies with a total of 171 patients and a survey study of 783 healthcare professionals. Fever (74%), cough (52%), and dyspnea (33%) were the most frequently reported symptoms, and 63% showed abnormalities on X-ray imaging. In the included case series and reports (N = 31), only 1 patient required mechanical ventilation, but 3 patients died (10%). The mortality rate in a large registry study (N = 140) was 19%. Clinical presentation of COVID-19 in SCI patients was similar to the general population, and though adverse events and intensive care unit admission were low, the mortality rate was high (10-19%). No prognostic factors for severe disease or mortality could be identified. Registration (PROSPERO): CRD42020196565.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Objectives: To evaluate clinical features, laboratory test results, maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant patients with the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Background: COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease caused by a severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Healthy pregnant women are more susceptible to developing COVID-19. Methods: We reviewed clinical data from pregnant patients with a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, who were admitted to two tertiary care hospitals in Turkey. Demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory test results, imaging findings, treatment received, maternal and neonatal outcomes were collected. Results: A total of 24 pregnant women were enrolled in this study. The mean maternal and gestational age was 26.9±5.37 years and 24.15±10.61 weeks, respectively. Cough was observed as the most common symptom (n=15; 62.5 %). The lowest lymphocyte percentage was 20.83±13.05 (%). Nine women have delivered by Caesarean section, while one had a vaginal birth. One woman with critical COVID-19 died 2 days later postpartum. The neonate had been transferred to neonatal intensive care unit and died within 24 hours of birth. Conclusion: Our findings showed that except for one patient, the clinical course of COVID-19 during pregnancy was mild. Early hospitalization of pregnant women with confirmed and suspected COVID-19, liberal testing for SARS-CoV-2, active management with a multidisciplinary team seemed to be critical to recovery (Tab. 3, Ref. 31).</Abstract>

        <Title>Prophylactic anticoagulants for people hospitalised with COVID-19 Prophylactic anticoagulants for people hospitalised with COVID-19</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The primary manifestation is respiratory insufficiency that can also be related to diffuse pulmonary microthrombosis in people with COVID-19. This disease also causes thromboembolic events, such as pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, catheter thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Recent studies have indicated a worse prognosis for people with COVID-19 who developed thromboembolism. Anticoagulants are medications used in the prevention and treatment of venous or arterial thromboembolic events. Several drugs are used in the prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic events, such as heparinoids (heparins or pentasaccharides), vitamin K antagonists and direct anticoagulants. Besides their anticoagulant properties, heparinoids have an additional anti-inflammatory potential, that may affect the clinical evolution of people with COVID-19. Some practical guidelines address the use of anticoagulants for thromboprophylaxis in people with COVID-19, however, the benefit of anticoagulants for people with COVID-19 is still under debate. Objectives: To assess the effects of prophylactic anticoagulants versus active comparator, placebo or no intervention, on mortality and the need for respiratory support in people hospitalised with COVID-19. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and IBECS databases, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and medRxiv preprint database from their inception to 20 June 2020. We also checked reference lists of any relevant systematic reviews identified and contacted specialists in the field for additional references to trials. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cluster-RCTs and cohort studies that compared prophylactic anticoagulants (heparin, vitamin K antagonists, direct anticoagulants, and pentasaccharides) versus active comparator, placebo or no intervention for the management of people hospitalised with COVID-19. We excluded studies without a comparator group. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and need for additional respiratory support. Secondary outcomes were mortality related to COVID-19, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, major bleeding, adverse events, length of hospital stay and quality of life. Data collection and analysis: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used ROBINS-I to assess risk of bias for non-randomised studies (NRS) and GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. We reported results narratively. Main results: We identified no RCTs or quasi-RCTs that met the inclusion criteria. We included seven retrospective NRS (5929 participants), three of which were available as preprints. Studies were conducted in China, Italy, Spain and the USA. All of the studies included people hospitalised with COVID-19, in either intensive care units, hospital wards or emergency departments. The mean age of participants (reported in 6 studies) ranged from 59 to 72 years. Only three included studies reported the follow-up period, which varied from 8 to 35 days. The studies did not report on most of our outcomes of interest: need for additional respiratory support, mortality related to COVID-19, DVT, pulmonary embolism, adverse events, and quality of life. Anticoagulants (all types) versus no treatment (6 retrospective NRS, 5685 participants) One study reported a reduction in all-cause mortality (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.66; 2075 participants). One study reported a reduction in mortality only in a subgroup of 395 people who required mechanical ventilation (hazard ratio (HR) 0.86, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.89). Three studies reported no differences in mortality (adjusted OR 1.64, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.92; 449 participants; unadjusted OR 1.66, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.64; 154 participants and adjusted risk ratio (RR) 1.15, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.57; 192 participants). One study reported zero events in both intervention groups (42 participants). The overall risk of bias for all-cause mortality was critical and the certainty of the evidence was very low. One NRS reported bleeding events in 3% of the intervention group and 1.9% of the control group (OR 1.62, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.71; 2773 participants; low-certainty evidence). Therapeutic-dose anticoagulants versus prophylactic-dose anticoagulants (1 retrospective NRS, 244 participants) The study reported a reduction in all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.46) and a lower absolute rate of death in the therapeutic group (34.2% versus 53%). The overall risk of bias for all-cause mortality was serious and the certainty of the evidence was low. The study also reported bleeding events in 31.7% of the intervention group and 20.5% of the control group (OR 1.8, 95% CI 0.96 to 3.37; low-certainty evidence). Ongoing studies We found 22 ongoing studies in hospital settings (20 RCTs, 14,730 participants; 2 NRS, 997 participants) in 10 different countries (Australia (1), Brazil (1), Canada (2), China (3), France (2), Germany (1), Italy (4), Switzerland (1), UK (1) and USA (6)). Twelve ongoing studies plan to report mortality and six plan to report additional respiratory support. Thirteen studies are expected to be completed in December 2020 (6959 participants), eight in July 2021 (8512 participants), and one in December 2021 (256 participants). Four of the studies plan to include 1000 participants or more. Authors' conclusions: There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the risks and benefits of prophylactic anticoagulants for people hospitalised with COVID-19. Since there are 22 ongoing studies that plan to evaluate more than 15,000 participants in this setting, we will add more robust evidence to this review in future updates.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Aim: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related to acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with poor prognosis and an increased risk of mortality. Early predicting COVID-19 related renal dysfunction may affect the prognosis of COVID-19 as well as reducing the risk of AKI. This study aims to determine the frequency of COVID-19 related AKI and to identify the early predictors of AKI. Methods: This study is a single-center, retrospective, observational study. Hospitalized confirmed COVID-19 patients between 24 March 2020 and 31 May 2020 were included in the study. All patients were evaluated for renal dysfunctions with urine dipstick, protein/creatinine ratio, albumin/creatinine ratio in spot urine, serum cystatin C, serum creatinine level on hospital admission, and 28th day of hospital admission. To assess the utility of these parameters to predict AKI, a receiver-operating characteristic curve was generated and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Results: 348 patients were included. The average incidence of AKI was 4.9% (n=17). The incidence of AKI in mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 cases was 1.3% (n=4), 9.0 % (n=3) and 76.9% (n=10), respectively. Proteinuria was detected in 7.8% (n=27) of patients with a urine dipstick test. In spot urine analysis, proteinuria was found in 20.1% (n=70) of patients. The frequency of persistent proteinuria was 5.2% (n=18). The AUC value of serum cystatin C, D-dimer and albumin/creatinine ratio to predict COVID-19 related AKI were 0.96 (0.90 to 1.0), 0.94 (0.89 to 0.98) and 0.95 (0.91 to 0.98). Conclusion: In COVID-19 patients with normal serum creatinine levels on hospital admission, albuminuria, serum cystatin C and D-dimer levels may be an early predictor of COVID-19 related AKI and these patients should be monitored closely for AKI. Since the sample size in the AKI group was small, our study results should be confirmed with larger cohort studies.</Abstract>

        <Title>Effective treatment with Tocilizumab in a COVID-19 patient on maintenance hemodialysis: A case report Effective treatment with Tocilizumab in a COVID-19 patient on maintenance hemodialysis: A case report</Title>
        <Abstract>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly spreading infective disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus (SARS-CoV-2). The management of this disease remains a challenge particularly in certain subgroups of patients such in hemodialysis patients who have higher exposure rates due to the nature of their in-hospital care, and higher mortality due to their burden of comorbidities. We report a case of a 52-year-old patient with Von Hippel Lindau syndrome and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis who contracted COVID-19 infection. Despite the patient's rapidly deteriorating clinical status he was successfully treated with Tocilizumab, after which he showed rapid improvement in his clinical, biological and radiological parameters. Although few studies were available regarding the use of Tocilizumab in the dialysis population, its use proved to be effective and well tolerated in our patient.</Abstract>

        <Title>Facemask headache: a new nosographic entity among healthcare providers in COVID-19 era Facemask headache: a new nosographic entity among healthcare providers in COVID-19 era</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel infectious agent causing coronavirus disease 2019, which has been declared as pandemic in March 2020. Personal protective equipment has been mandatory for healthcare workers in order to contain the outbreak of pandemic disease. Mild neurological disturbances such as headache have been related to the extensive utilization of facemask. This study aims to examine headache variations related to the intensive utilization of facemask among a cohort of healthcare professionals in a setting of low-medium risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study among healthcare providers from different hospital and clinics in Italy. Each participant completed a specifically designed self-administered questionnaire. Headache features and outcome measures' change from baseline were evaluated over a 4-month period, in which wearing facemask has become mandatory for Italian healthcare workers. Results: A total of 400 healthcare providers completed the questionnaire, 383 of them met the inclusion criteria. The majority were doctors, with a mean age of 33.4 ± 9.2 years old. Among 166/383 subjects, who were headache free at baseline, 44 (26.5%) developed de novo headache. Furthermore, 217/383 reported a previous diagnosis of primary headache disorder: 137 were affected by migraine and 80 had tension-type headache. A proportion (31.3%) of these primary headache sufferers experienced worsening of their pre-existing headache disorder, mainly for migraine frequency and attack mean duration. Conclusions: Our data showed the appearance of de novo associated facemask headache in previous headache-free subjects and an exacerbation of pre-existing primary headache disorders, mostly experienced by people with migraine disease.</Abstract>

        <Title>Pulmonary vascular enlargement and lesion extent on computed tomography are correlated with COVID-19 disease severity Pulmonary vascular enlargement and lesion extent on computed tomography are correlated with COVID-19 disease severity</Title>
        <Abstract>Purpose: To assess the relationships among pulmonary vascular enlargement, computed tomography (CT) findings quantified with software, and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) severity. Materials and methods: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) CT images of 87 patients (50 males, 37 females; median age, 63 years) with COVID-19 confirmed using real-time polymerase chain reaction were analyzed. The maximum subsegmental vascular diameter was measured on CT. Total CT lung volume (CTLV total) and lesion extent (ratio of lesion volume to CTLV total) of ground-glass opacities, reticulation, and consolidation were measured using software. Maximum pulmonary vascular diameter and lesion extent were analyzed using Spearman's correlation analysis. Logistic regression analysis was performed on CT results to predict disease severity. We also assessed changes in these measures on follow-up scans in 16 patients. Results: All 23 patients with severe and critical illness had vascular enlargement (&gt; 4 mm). Pulmonary vascular enlargement (odds ratio 3.05, p = 0.018) and CT lesion extent (odds ratio 1.07, p = 0.002) were independent predictors of disease severity after adjustment for age and comorbidities. On follow-up CT, vascular diameter and CT lesion volume decreased (p = 0.001, p = 0.002; respectively), but CTLV total did not change significantly. Conclusion: Subsegmental vascular enlargement is a notable finding to predict acute COVID-19 disease severity.</Abstract>

        <Title>Evaluating the longitudinal effectiveness of preventive measures against COVID-19 and seroprevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in cancer outpatients and healthcare workers Evaluating the longitudinal effectiveness of preventive measures against COVID-19 and seroprevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in cancer outpatients and healthcare workers</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: It has been assumed that cancer patients, especially those undergoing chemotherapy, are at increased risk for infection and severe illness from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) compared to the general population. After the first alert message from the local healthcare service, a series of drastic measures were taken at our outpatient clinic to contain the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: In this retrospective study, all consecutive cancer outpatients completed a baseline SARS-CoV‑2 test via real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from 15 March to 26 May 2020. In the later phase, after the peak of the pandemic, patients as well as healthcare workers were tested for anti-SARS-CoV‑2 IgG antibodies. Results: Between 15 March and 26 May 2020, 0.78% (N = 5/640) cancer patients tested positive for SARS-CoV‑2 by RT-PCR. Between 22 June and 17 July 2020, anti-SARS-CoV‑2 IgG antibodies were detected in 2 out of 250 (0.8%) cancer patients and 2 out of 36 (5.5%) healthcare workers. In only 1 out of 4 cancer patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, could SARS-CoV‑2 antibodies be detected. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the majority of our patients and healthcare workers had not been infected with SARS-CoV‑2 and rapidly implemented measures were effective. Maintenance of preventive measures should be continued until vaccines or specific treatments are available.</Abstract>

        <Title>Preoperative assessment for scheduling surgery during the coronavirus disease pandemic Preoperative assessment for scheduling surgery during the coronavirus disease pandemic</Title>
        <Abstract>On Mar 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a pandemic. Because COVID-19 has a pre-symptomatic period of up to 2 weeks, SARS-CoV-2 infection has continued to spread. Some individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection have a severe clinical course, while most individuals have mild or moderate symptoms. Because SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via droplets and secretions, anesthesiologists have higher risks of infection, especially during airway management. Therefore, general anesthesia requiring airway management can be a challenging procedure for anesthesiologists. During the pandemic, many elective surgeries have been postponed or cancelled in most affected countries. Recently, the number of elective surgeries is gradually recovering from the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, and hence, safe clinical practice and protocols to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission to medical staff should be established. This mini-review focuses on the preoperative assessment and decision with regard to scheduling surgery in elective and emergency cases during the COVID-19 pandemic. A standardized questionnaire and algorithm regarding COVID-19 should be used to assess surgical patients preoperatively as it increases the reproducibility and accuracy of the decision whether to proceed with surgery.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Introduction: Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, healthcare systems have focused their efforts into finding a treatment to avoid the fatal outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome due to coronavirus‑2 (SARS-CoV-2). Benefits and risks of systemic treatments remain unclear, with multiple clinical trials still ongoing. Radiotherapy could play a role in reducing the inflammatory response in the lungs and relieve life-threatening symptoms. Methods: We designed a prospective study of Ultra-Low Doses of Therapy with Radiation Applied to COVID-19 (ULTRA-COVID) for patients who suffer pneumonia, are not candidates for invasive mechanical ventilation and show no improvement with medical therapy. Results: We present the preliminary results of two patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia treated with ULTRA-COVID. After one radiotherapy session, significant clinical response and a good radiological response was observed in both cases, resulting in both patients being discharged from hospital in less than 2 weeks after radiation treatment. Conclusion: Preliminary clinical and radiological results suggest a potential benefit of treating COVID-19 pneumonia with ULTRA-COVID. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04394182.</Abstract>

        <Title>Respiratory and Psychophysical Sequelae Among Patients With COVID-19 Four Months After Hospital Discharge Respiratory and Psychophysical Sequelae Among Patients With COVID-19 Four Months After Hospital Discharge</Title>
        <Abstract>Importance: Although plenty of data exist regarding clinical manifestations, course, case fatality rate, and risk factors associated with mortality in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), long-term respiratory and functional sequelae in survivors of COVID-19 are unknown. Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of lung function anomalies, exercise function impairment, and psychological sequelae among patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 4 months after discharge. Design, setting, and participants: This prospective cohort study at an academic hospital in Northern Italy was conducted among a consecutive series of patients aged 18 years and older (or their caregivers) who had received a confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection severe enough to require hospital admission from March 1 to June 29, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing, bronchial swab, serological testing, or suggestive computed tomography results. Exposure: Severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome of the study was to describe the proportion of patients with a diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (Dlco) less than 80% of expected value. Secondary outcomes included proportion of patients with severe lung function impairment (defined as Dlco &lt;60% expected value); proportion of patients with posttraumatic stress symptoms (measured using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised total score); proportion of patients with functional impairment (assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery [SPPB] score and 2-minute walking test); and identification of factors associated with Dlco reduction and psychological or functional sequelae. Results: Among 767 patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19, 494 (64.4%) refused to participate, and 35 (4.6%) died during follow-up. A total of 238 patients (31.0%) (median [interquartile range] age, 61 [50-71] years; 142 [59.7%] men; median [interquartile range] comorbidities, 2 [1-3]) consented to participate to the study. Of these, 219 patients were able to complete both pulmonary function tests and Dlco measurement. Dlco was reduced to less than 80% of the estimated value in 113 patients (51.6%) and less than 60% in 34 patients (15.5%). The SPPB score was suggested limited mobility (score &lt;11) in 53 patients (22.3%). Patients with SPPB scores within reference range underwent a 2-minute walk test, which was outside reference ranges of expected performance for age and sex in 75 patients (40.5%); thus, a total of 128 patients (53.8%) had functional impairment. Posttraumatic stress symptoms were reported in a total of 41 patients (17.2%). Conclusions and relevance: These findings suggest that at 4 months after discharge, respiratory, physical, and psychological sequelae were common among patients who had been hospitalized for COVID-19.</Abstract>

        <Title>Association of Serum Mannose With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Risk and Survival Association of Serum Mannose With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Risk and Survival</Title>
        <Abstract>Importance: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) confers high mortality risk among critically ill patients. Identification of biomarkers associated with ARDS risk may guide clinical diagnosis and prognosis. Objective: To systematically evaluate the association of blood metabolites with ARDS risk and survival. Design, setting, and participants: In this cohort study, data from the Molecular Epidemiology of ARDS (MEARDS) study, a prospective cohort of 403 patients with ARDS and 1227 non-ARDS controls, were analyzed. Patients were recruited in intensive care units (ICUs) at Massachusetts General Hospital and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, both in Boston, Massachusetts, from January 1, 1998, to December 31, 2014. Data analysis was performed from December 9, 2018, to January 4, 2019. Main outcomes and measures: Participants were followed up daily for ARDS development defined by Berlin criteria, requiring fulfillment of chest radiograph and oxygenation criteria on the same calendar day during invasive ventilatory assistance. A 2-stage study design was used to explore novel metabolites associated with ARDS risk and survival. Results: Of the 1630 participants from MEARDS who were admitted to the ICU , 403 (24.7%) were diagnosed with ARDS (mean [SD] age, 63.0 [17.0] years; 251 [62.3%] male) and 1227 (75.3%) were at-risk but did not have ARDS (mean [SD] age, 62.3 [16.9] years; 753 [61.4%] male). Mendelian randomization suggested that genetically regulated serum mannose was associated with ARDS risk (odds ratio [OR], 0.64; 95% CI, 0.53-0.78; P = 7.46 × 10-6) in the discovery stage. In the functional validation stage incorporating 83 participants with ARDS and matched at-risk participants in the control group from the ICU, the protective association of mannose with ARDS risk was validated (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46-0.97; P = .03). Furthermore, serum mannose was associated with 28-day (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.11-0.56; P = 6.95 × 10-4) and 60-day (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.19-0.71; P = 3.12 × 10-3) mortality and 28-day (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.32-0.74; P = 6.41 × 10-4) and 60-day (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.37-0.80; P = 2.11 × 10-3) survival. Conclusions and relevance: In this study, genetically regulated serum mannose appeared to be associated with ARDS risk and outcome, and increased serum mannose at admission was associated with reduced ARDS risk and better survival. These findings could inform prevention and clinical intervention in ARDS cases, which have increased with the expansion of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.</Abstract>

        <Title>Development of a Model to Estimate the Association Between Delay in Cancer Treatment and Local Tumor Control and Risk of Metastases Development of a Model to Estimate the Association Between Delay in Cancer Treatment and Local Tumor Control and Risk of Metastases</Title>
        <Abstract>Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to treatment delays for many patients with cancer. While published guidelines provide suggestions on which cases are appropriate for treatment delay, there are no good quantitative estimates on the association of delays with tumor control or risk of new metastases. Objectives: To develop a simplified mathematical model of tumor growth, control, and new metastases for cancers with varying doubling times and metastatic potential and to estimate tumor control probability (TCP) and metastases risk as a function of treatment delay interval. Design, setting, and participants: This decision analytical model describes a quantitative model for 3 tumors (ie, head and neck, colorectal, and non-small cell lung cancers). Using accepted ranges of tumor doubling times and metastatic development from the clinical literature from 2001 to 2020, estimates of tumor growth, TCP, and new metastases were analyzed for various treatment delay intervals. Main outcomes and measures: Risk estimates for potential decreases in local TCP and increases in new metastases with each interval of treatment delay. Results: For fast-growing head and neck tumors with a 2-month treatment delay, there was an estimated 4.8% (95% CI, 3.4%-6.4%) increase in local tumor control risk and a 0.49% (0.47%-0.51%) increase in new distal metastases risk. A 6-month delay was associated with an estimated 21.3% (13.4-30.4) increase in local tumor control risk and a 6.0% (5.2-6.8) increase in distal metastases risk. For intermediate-growing colorectal tumors, there was a 2.1% (0.7%-3.5%) increase in local tumor control risk and a 2.7% (2.6%-2.8%) increase in distal metastases risk at 2 months and a 7.6% (2.2%-14.2%) increase in local tumor control risk and a 24.7% (21.9%-27.8%) increase in distal metastases risk at 6 months. For slower-growing lung tumors, there was a 1.2% (0.0%-2.8%) increase in local tumor control risk and a 0.19% (0.18%-0.20%) increase in distal metastases risk at 2 months, and a 4.3% (0.0%-10.6%) increase in local tumor control risk and a 1.9% (1.6%-2.2%) increase in distal metastases risk at 6 months. Conclusions and relevance: This study proposed a model to quantify the association of treatment delays with local tumor control and risk of new metastases. The detrimental associations were greatest for tumors with faster rates of proliferation and metastasis. The associations were smaller, but still substantial, for slower-growing tumors.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to produce substantial morbidity and mortality. To understand the reasons for the wide-spectrum complications and severe outcomes of COVID-19, we aimed to identify cellular targets of SARS-CoV-2 tropism and replication in various tissues. Methods: We evaluated RNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded autopsy tissues from 64 case-patients (age range: 1 month to 84 years; COVID-19 confirmed n=21, suspected n=43) by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. For cellular localization of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and viral characterization, we performed in-situ hybridization (ISH), subgenomic RNA RT-PCR, and whole genome sequencing. Results: SARS-CoV-2 was identified by RT-PCR in 32 case-patients (confirmed n=21 and suspected n=11). ISH was positive in 20 and subgenomic RNA RT-PCR was positive in 17 of 32 RT-PCR-positive case-patients. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was localized by ISH in hyaline membranes, pneumocytes and macrophages of lungs, epithelial cells of airways, and in endothelial cells and vessels wall of brain stem, leptomeninges, lung, heart, liver, kidney, and pancreas. D614G variant was detected in 9 RT-PCR-positive case-patients. Conclusions: We identified cellular targets of SARS-CoV-2 tropism and replication in the lungs and airways and demonstrated its direct infection in vascular endothelium. This work provides important insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis and mechanisms of severe outcomes.</Abstract>

        <Title>Association of Psychiatric Disorders With Mortality Among Patients With COVID-19 Association of Psychiatric Disorders With Mortality Among Patients With COVID-19</Title>
        <Abstract>Importance: To date, the association of psychiatric diagnoses with mortality in patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has not been evaluated. Objective: To assess whether a diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, mood disorder, or anxiety disorder is associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19. Design, setting, and participants: This retrospective cohort study assessed 7348 consecutive adult patients for 45 days following laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between March 3 and May 31, 2020, in a large academic medical system in New York. The final date of follow-up was July 15, 2020. Patients without available medical records before testing were excluded. Exposures: Patients were categorized based on the following International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnoses before their testing date: (1) schizophrenia spectrum disorders, (2) mood disorders, and (3) anxiety disorders. Patients with these diagnoses were compared with a reference group without psychiatric disorders. Main outcomes and measures: Mortality, defined as death or discharge to hospice within 45 days following a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test result. Results: Of the 26 540 patients tested, 7348 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 54 [18.6] years; 3891 [53.0%] women). Of eligible patients with positive test results, 75 patients (1.0%) had a history of a schizophrenia spectrum illness, 564 (7.7%) had a history of a mood disorder, and 360 (4.9%) had a history of an anxiety disorder. After adjusting for demographic and medical risk factors, a premorbid diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder was significantly associated with mortality (odds ratio [OR], 2.67; 95% CI, 1.48-4.80). Diagnoses of mood disorders (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.87-1.49) and anxiety disorders (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.65-1.41) were not associated with mortality after adjustment. In comparison with other risk factors, a diagnosis of schizophrenia ranked behind only age in strength of an association with mortality. Conclusions and relevance: In this cohort study of adults with SARS-CoV-2-positive test results in a large New York medical system, adults with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder diagnosis were associated with an increased risk for mortality, but those with mood and anxiety disorders were not associated with a risk of mortality. These results suggest that schizophrenia spectrum disorders may be a risk factor for mortality in patients with COVID-19.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Objectives: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with diverse clinical, including hematologic, abnormalities. We describe peripheral blood and bone marrow findings in deceased and living patients with COVID-19. Methods: We examined bone marrows from 20 autopsies and 2 living patients with COVID-19 using H&amp;E-stained slides and immunohistochemical stains. Clinical history and laboratory values were reviewed. HScore was calculated to estimate risk of hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (HLH). Results: The deceased patients included 12 men and 8 women (aged 32 to &gt;89 years; median, 63 years). Hematologic abnormalities included frequent neutrophilic leukocytosis, lymphopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia; one patient showed striking erythrocytosis. The bone marrows were all normocellular to hypercellular, most showing maturing trilineage hematopoiesis with myeloid left shift. In all 19 evaluable bone marrows, hemophagocytic histiocytes were identified. The HScore for secondary HLH ranged from 35 to 269 (median, 125; &gt;169 in 5 patients). Coinfections were identified in 6 patients. In 2 living patients, bone marrow showed maturing trilineage hematopoiesis, including one showing few hemophagocytic histiocytes. Conclusions: Peripheral blood from deceased patients with COVID-19 frequently showed neutrophilic leukocytosis, lymphopenia, and, rarely, secondary polycythemia; hemophagocytosis was common in their bone marrow. Consistent with other studies, we provide histopathologic evidence of secondary HLH development in patients with COVID-19.</Abstract>

        <Title>CRISPR Systems for COVID-19 Diagnosis CRISPR Systems for COVID-19 Diagnosis</Title>
        <Abstract>The emergence of the new coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) was first seen in December 2019, which has spread rapidly and become a global pandemic. The number of cases of COVID-19 and its associated mortality have raised serious concerns worldwide. Early diagnosis of viral infection undoubtedly allows rapid intervention, disease management, and substantial control of the rapid spread of the disease. Currently, the standard approach for COVID-19 diagnosis globally is the RT-qPCR test; however, the limited access to kits and associated reagents, the need for specialized lab equipment, and the need for highly skilled personnel has led to a detection slowdown. Recently, the development of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based diagnostic systems has reshaped molecular diagnosis. The benefits of the CRISPR system such as speed, precision, specificity, strength, efficiency, and versatility have inspired researchers to develop CRISPR-based diagnostic and therapeutic methods. With the global COVID-19 outbreak, different groups have begun to design and develop diagnostic and therapeutic programs based on the efficient CRISPR system. CRISPR-based COVID-19 diagnostic systems have advantages such as a high detection speed (i.e., 30 min from raw sample to reach a result), high sensitivity and precision, portability, and no need for specialized laboratory equipment. Here, we review contemporary studies on the detection of COVID-19 based on the CRISPR system.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Aim: The significance and prioritization of early phase oncology trial continuation during a global pandemic is unknown. This study reported the outcomes, multiple challenges, and broad recommendations associated with the impact of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on oncology early phase 1 trials-and on drug development in Asia-based on the experiences and perspectives of Asian oncology phase 1 centers. Methods: Between March and April 2020 during the initial period of outbreak, the impact of COVID-19 across oncology phase 1 sites in five Asian countries-China (Hong Kong), Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore-was retrospectively analyzed. Results: There was no trial termination or treatment discontinuation in all five countries. Although the most common impact was new patient enrollment being placed on hold, which was based on pharmaceutical sponsors' decision-making, the situation varied per site. Most sites had no restrictions in place that would limit their ability to fully comply with the requirements of conducting the early phase studies. The number of protocol deviations during the pandemic was largely dependent on domestic transportation status during the outbreak rather than the ability of the clinical trial centers. Conclusion: Determining the risk to benefits ratio of patients with cancer who are enrolled in early phase 1 clinical trials under the unusual circumstances of a global pandemic is important. Specific guidance or guidelines on the conduct of early phase 1 clinical trials during public health emergencies that are based on the recent lessons learned is urgently required.</Abstract>

        <Title>An early experience of COVID-19 disease in pediatric and young adult renal transplant recipients An early experience of COVID-19 disease in pediatric and young adult renal transplant recipients</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: COVID-19 is caused by a novel form of coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2. Patients can present with a wide variety of symptoms from fever to severe respiratory distress. Immunocompromised patients, including solid organ transplant recipients, may present with atypical symptoms, making the diagnosis of COVID-19 more difficult to make. New reports have been emerging about the management of COVID-19 disease in adult renal transplant recipients. However, very little is known in pediatric renal transplant recipients. Methods: Here, we describe a case report of four pediatric renal transplant recipients who presented with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 disease. Results: All patients presented with upper respiratory infection symptoms, with one requiring hospitalization for hypoxia. Patients were treated mostly with supportive care. Two of the patients developed AKI which resolved four to eight weeks after illness. All four patients developed COVID IgG antibodies one to two months after becoming infected. Conclusion: This case series demonstrates that immunocompromised renal transplant recipients have comparable outcomes compared with immunocompetent children.</Abstract>

        <Title>Travel-related control measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid review Travel-related control measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid review</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: In late 2019, first cases of coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, were reported in Wuhan, China. Subsequently COVID-19 spread rapidly around the world. To contain the ensuing pandemic, numerous countries have implemented control measures related to international travel, including border closures, partial travel restrictions, entry or exit screening, and quarantine of travellers. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of travel-related control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic on infectious disease and screening-related outcomes. Search methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19-specific databases, including the WHO Global Database on COVID-19 Research, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and the CDC COVID-19 Research Database on 26 June 2020. We also conducted backward-citation searches with existing reviews. Selection criteria: We considered experimental, quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of travel-related control measures affecting human travel across national borders during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also included studies concerned with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) as indirect evidence. Primary outcomes were cases avoided, cases detected and a shift in epidemic development due to the measures. Secondary outcomes were other infectious disease transmission outcomes, healthcare utilisation, resource requirements and adverse effects if identified in studies assessing at least one primary outcome. Data collection and analysis: One review author screened titles and abstracts; all excluded abstracts were screened in duplicate. Two review authors independently screened full texts. One review author extracted data, assessed risk of bias and appraised study quality. At least one additional review author checked for correctness of all data reported in the 'Risk of bias' assessment, quality appraisal and data synthesis. For assessing the risk of bias and quality of included studies, we used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool for observational studies concerned with screening, ROBINS-I for observational ecological studies and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. One review author assessed certainty of evidence with GRADE, and the review author team discussed ratings. Main results: We included 40 records reporting on 36 unique studies. We found 17 modelling studies, 7 observational screening studies and one observational ecological study on COVID-19, four modelling and six observational studies on SARS, and one modelling study on SARS and MERS, covering a variety of settings and epidemic stages. Most studies compared travel-related control measures against a counterfactual scenario in which the intervention measure was not implemented. However, some modelling studies described additional comparator scenarios, such as different levels of travel restrictions, or a combination of measures. There were concerns with the quality of many modelling studies and the risk of bias of observational studies. Many modelling studies used potentially inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters of models, and failed to adequately assess uncertainty. Concerns with observational screening studies commonly related to the reference test and the flow of the screening process. Studies on COVID-19 Travel restrictions reducing cross-border travel Eleven studies employed models to simulate a reduction in travel volume; one observational ecological study assessed travel restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Very low-certainty evidence from modelling studies suggests that when implemented at the beginning of the outbreak, cross-border travel restrictions may lead to a reduction in the number of new cases of between 26% to 90% (4 studies), the number of deaths (1 study), the time to outbreak of between 2 and 26 days (2 studies), the risk of outbreak of between 1% to 37% (2 studies), and the effective reproduction number (1 modelling and 1 observational ecological study). Low-certainty evidence from modelling studies suggests a reduction in the number of imported or exported cases of between 70% to 81% (5 studies), and in the growth acceleration of epidemic progression (1 study). Screening at borders with or without quarantine Evidence from three modelling studies of entry and exit symptom screening without quarantine suggests delays in the time to outbreak of between 1 to 183 days (very low-certainty evidence) and a detection rate of infected travellers of between 10% to 53% (low-certainty evidence). Six observational studies of entry and exit screening were conducted in specific settings such as evacuation flights and cruise ship outbreaks. Screening approaches varied but followed a similar structure, involving symptom screening of all individuals at departure or upon arrival, followed by quarantine, and different procedures for observation and PCR testing over a period of at least 14 days. The proportion of cases detected ranged from 0% to 91% (depending on the screening approach), and the positive predictive value ranged from 0% to 100% (very low-certainty evidence). The outcomes, however, should be interpreted in relation to both the screening approach used and the prevalence of infection among the travellers screened; for example, symptom-based screening alone generally performed worse than a combination of symptom-based and PCR screening with subsequent observation during quarantine. Quarantine of travellers Evidence from one modelling study simulating a 14-day quarantine suggests a reduction in the number of cases seeded by imported cases; larger reductions were seen with increasing levels of quarantine compliance ranging from 277 to 19 cases with rates of compliance modelled between 70% to 100% (very low-certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions: With much of the evidence deriving from modelling studies, notably for travel restrictions reducing cross-border travel and quarantine of travellers, there is a lack of 'real-life' evidence for many of these measures. The certainty of the evidence for most travel-related control measures is very low and the true effects may be substantially different from those reported here. Nevertheless, some travel-related control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic may have a positive impact on infectious disease outcomes. Broadly, travel restrictions may limit the spread of disease across national borders. Entry and exit symptom screening measures on their own are not likely to be effective in detecting a meaningful proportion of cases to prevent seeding new cases within the protected region; combined with subsequent quarantine, observation and PCR testing, the effectiveness is likely to improve. There was insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of travel-related quarantine on its own. Some of the included studies suggest that effects are likely to depend on factors such as the stage of the epidemic, the interconnectedness of countries, local measures undertaken to contain community transmission, and the extent of implementation and adherence.</Abstract>

        <Title>Digital contact tracing technologies in epidemics: a rapid review Digital contact tracing technologies in epidemics: a rapid review</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: Reducing the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global priority. Contact tracing identifies people who were recently in contact with an infected individual, in order to isolate them and reduce further transmission. Digital technology could be implemented to augment and accelerate manual contact tracing. Digital tools for contact tracing may be grouped into three areas: 1) outbreak response; 2) proximity tracing; and 3) symptom tracking. We conducted a rapid review on the effectiveness of digital solutions to contact tracing during infectious disease outbreaks. Objectives: To assess the benefits, harms, and acceptability of personal digital contact tracing solutions for identifying contacts of an identified positive case of an infectious disease. Search methods: An information specialist searched the literature from 1 January 2000 to 5 May 2020 in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. Additionally, we screened the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs, quasi-RCTs, cohort studies, cross-sectional studies and modelling studies, in general populations. We preferentially included studies of contact tracing during infectious disease outbreaks (including COVID-19, Ebola, tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome) as direct evidence, but considered comparative studies of contact tracing outside an outbreak as indirect evidence. The digital solutions varied but typically included software (or firmware) for users to install on their devices or to be uploaded to devices provided by governments or third parties. Control measures included traditional or manual contact tracing, self-reported diaries and surveys, interviews, other standard methods for determining close contacts, and other technologies compared to digital solutions (e.g. electronic medical records). Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened records and all potentially relevant full-text publications. One review author extracted data for 50% of the included studies, another extracted data for the remaining 50%; the second review author checked all the extracted data. One review author assessed quality of included studies and a second checked the assessments. Our outcomes were identification of secondary cases and close contacts, time to complete contact tracing, acceptability and accessibility issues, privacy and safety concerns, and any other ethical issue identified. Though modelling studies will predict estimates of the effects of different contact tracing solutions on outcomes of interest, cohort studies provide empirically measured estimates of the effects of different contact tracing solutions on outcomes of interest. We used GRADE-CERQual to describe certainty of evidence from qualitative data and GRADE for modelling and cohort studies. Main results: We identified six cohort studies reporting quantitative data and six modelling studies reporting simulations of digital solutions for contact tracing. Two cohort studies also provided qualitative data. Three cohort studies looked at contact tracing during an outbreak, whilst three emulated an outbreak in non-outbreak settings (schools). Of the six modelling studies, four evaluated digital solutions for contact tracing in simulated COVID-19 scenarios, while two simulated close contacts in non-specific outbreak settings. Modelling studies Two modelling studies provided low-certainty evidence of a reduction in secondary cases using digital contact tracing (measured as average number of secondary cases per index case - effective reproductive number (R eff)). One study estimated an 18% reduction in R eff with digital contact tracing compared to self-isolation alone, and a 35% reduction with manual contact-tracing. Another found a reduction in R eff for digital contact tracing compared to self-isolation alone (26% reduction) and a reduction in R eff for manual contact tracing compared to self-isolation alone (53% reduction). However, the certainty of evidence was reduced by unclear specifications of their models, and assumptions about the effectiveness of manual contact tracing (assumed 95% to 100% of contacts traced), and the proportion of the population who would have the app (53%). Cohort studies Two cohort studies provided very low-certainty evidence of a benefit of digital over manual contact tracing. During an Ebola outbreak, contact tracers using an app found twice as many close contacts per case on average than those using paper forms. Similarly, after a pertussis outbreak in a US hospital, researchers found that radio-frequency identification identified 45 close contacts but searches of electronic medical records found 13. The certainty of evidence was reduced by concerns about imprecision, and serious risk of bias due to the inability of contact tracing study designs to identify the true number of close contacts. One cohort study provided very low-certainty evidence that an app could reduce the time to complete a set of close contacts. The certainty of evidence for this outcome was affected by imprecision and serious risk of bias. Contact tracing teams reported that digital data entry and management systems were faster to use than paper systems and possibly less prone to data loss. Two studies from lower- or middle-income countries, reported that contact tracing teams found digital systems simpler to use and generally preferred them over paper systems; they saved personnel time, reportedly improved accuracy with large data sets, and were easier to transport compared with paper forms. However, personnel faced increased costs and internet access problems with digital compared to paper systems. Devices in the cohort studies appeared to have privacy from contacts regarding the exposed or diagnosed users. However, there were risks of privacy breaches from snoopers if linkage attacks occurred, particularly for wearable devices. Authors' conclusions: The effectiveness of digital solutions is largely unproven as there are very few published data in real-world outbreak settings. Modelling studies provide low-certainty evidence of a reduction in secondary cases if digital contact tracing is used together with other public health measures such as self-isolation. Cohort studies provide very low-certainty evidence that digital contact tracing may produce more reliable counts of contacts and reduce time to complete contact tracing. Digital solutions may have equity implications for at-risk populations with poor internet access and poor access to digital technology. Stronger primary research on the effectiveness of contact tracing technologies is needed, including research into use of digital solutions in conjunction with manual systems, as digital solutions are unlikely to be used alone in real-world settings. Future studies should consider access to and acceptability of digital solutions, and the resultant impact on equity. Studies should also make acceptability and uptake a primary research question, as privacy concerns can prevent uptake and effectiveness of these technologies.</Abstract>

A prospective observational study Characteristics, management and survival of ICU patients with coronavirus disease-19 in Norway, March - June 2020. A prospective observational study</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: Norwegian hospitals have operated within capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic. We present patient and management characteristics, and outcomes for the entire cohort of adult (&gt; 18 years) COVID-19 patients admitted to Norwegian intensive care units (ICU) from 10 March to 19 June 2020. Methods: Data were collected from The Norwegian intensive care and pandemic registry (NIPaR). Demographics, co-morbidities, management characteristics and outcomes are described. ICU length of stay (LOS) was analysed with linear regression, and associations between risk factors and mortality were quantified using Cox regression. Results: In total, 217 patients were included. The male to female ratio was 3:1 and the median age was 63 years. A majority (70%) had one or more co-morbidities, most frequently cardiovascular disease (39%), chronic lung disease (22%), diabetes mellitus (20%), and obesity (17%). Most patients were admitted for acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure (AHRF)(91%) and invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) was used in 86%, prone ventilation in 38% and 25% of patients received a tracheostomy. Vasoactive drugs were used in 79% and renal replacement therapy in 15%. Median ICU LOS and time of MV was 14.0 and 12.0 days. At end of follow-up 45 patients (21%) were dead. Age, co-morbidities and severity of illness at admission were predictive of death. Severity of AHRF and male gender were associated with LOS. Conclusions: In this national cohort of COVID-19 patients, mortality was low and attributable to known risk factors. Importantly, prolonged length-of-stay must be taken into account when planning for resource allocation for any next surge.</Abstract>

        <Title>Results of mental support for health care professionals and mental care during the COVID-19 pandemic Results of mental support for health care professionals and mental care during the COVID-19 pandemic</Title>
        <Abstract>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulted into a global pandemic and continues to thrive until vaccines have been successfully developed and distributed around the world. The outcomes of COVID-19 contaminations range from death to minor health-related complaints. Furthermore, and not less significant, the increasing pressure on local as well as global health care is rising. In The Netherlands but also in other countries, further intensified regulations are introduced in order to contain the second wave of COVID-19, primarily to limit the number contaminations but also to prevent the health care professionals for giving in to the rising pressure on them. The results of the campaign for health care professionals in The Netherlands show that health care professionals are increasingly searching for information regarding psychological symptoms such as feeling of uncertainty, pondering and advice regarding the support of care teams. In this short update, we provide the results of the previous campaign and stress the importance of support after COVID-19 based on these results.</Abstract>

        <Title>COVID-19 in Immunocompromised Hosts: What We Know So Far COVID-19 in Immunocompromised Hosts: What We Know So Far</Title>
        <Abstract>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused significant morbidity and mortality for patients and stressed healthcare systems worldwide. The clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 among immunosuppressed patients, who are at presumed risk of more severe disease but who may also have decreased detrimental inflammatory responses, are not well characterized. We review the existing literature on COVID-19 among immunocompromised populations ranging from patients with cancer and solid-organ transplant recipients to patients with HIV and those receiving immunomodulatory therapy for autoimmune disease. Patients with malignancy and solid-organ transplant recipients may be at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease and death, whereas for those with other types of immunocompromise, current evidence is less clear. Overall, further prospective controlled studies are needed to determine the attributable risk of immunocompromising conditions and therapies on COVID-19 disease prognosis.</Abstract>

        <Title>Magnitude and Kinetics of Anti-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Antibody Responses and Their Relationship to Disease Severity Magnitude and Kinetics of Anti-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Antibody Responses and Their Relationship to Disease Severity</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can be detected indirectly by measuring the host immune response. For some viruses, antibody concentrations correlate with host protection and viral neutralization, but in rare cases, antiviral antibodies can promote disease progression. Elucidation of the kinetics and magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response is essential to understand the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and identify potential therapeutic targets. Methods: Sera (n = 533) from patients with real-time polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 (n = 94 with acute infections and n = 59 convalescent patients) were tested using a high-throughput quantitative immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) assay that detects antibodies to the spike protein receptor binding domain and nucleocapsid protein. Individual and serial samples covered the time of initial diagnosis, during the disease course, and following recovery. We evaluated antibody kinetics and correlation between magnitude of the response and disease severity. Results: Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 antibody production varied considerably. Among 52 patients with 3 or more serial specimens, 44 (84.6%) and 42 (80.8%) had observed IgM and IgG seroconversion at a median of 8 and 10 days, respectively. Compared to those with milder disease, peak measurements were significantly higher for patients admitted to the intensive care unit for all time intervals between 6 and 20 days for IgM, and all intervals after 5 days for IgG. Conclusions: High-sensitivity assays with a robust dynamic range provide a comprehensive picture of host antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. IgM and IgG responses were significantly higher in patients with severe than mild disease. These differences may affect strategies for seroprevalence studies, therapeutics, and vaccine development.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>The epidemic of novel coronavirus disease was first reported in China in late December 2019 and was brought under control after some 2 months in China. However, it has become a global pandemic, and the number of cases and deaths continues to increase outside of China. We describe the emergence of the pandemic, detail the first 100 days of China's response as a phase 1 containment strategy followed by phase 2 containment, and briefly highlight areas of focus for the future. Specific, simple, and pragmatic strategies used in China for risk assessment, prioritization, and deployment of resources are described. Details of implementation, at different risk levels, of the traditional public health interventions are shared. Involvement of society in mounting a whole country response and challenges experienced with logistics and supply chains are described. Finally, the methods China is employing to cautiously restart social life and economic activity are outlined.</Abstract>

        <Title>Comparing Dynamics and Determinants of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Transmissions Among Healthcare Workers of Adult and Pediatric Settings in Central Paris Comparing Dynamics and Determinants of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Transmissions Among Healthcare Workers of Adult and Pediatric Settings in Central Paris</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) have paid a heavy toll during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Routes of transmission remain to be fully understood. Methods: This prospective study compared a 1500-bed adult and 600-bed pediatric setting of a tertiary-care university hospital located in central Paris. From 24 February until 10 April 2020, all symptomatic HCWs were screened for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on a nasopharyngeal swab. HCWs screened positive were questioned on their profession, symptoms, and occupational and nonoccupational exposures to SARS-CoV-2. Results: Among 1344 HCWs tested, 373 were positive (28%) and 336 (90%) corresponding questionnaires were completed. Three hospitalizations and no deaths were reported. Most HCWs (70%) had patient-facing occupational activities (22% in COVID-19 dedicated units). The total number of HCW cases peaked on 23 March, then decreased slowly, concomitantly with a continuous increase of compliance to preventive measures (including universal medical masking and personal protective equipment [PPE] for direct care to COVID-19 patients). Attack rates were of 3.2% and 2.3% in the adult and pediatric settings, respectively (P = .0022). In the adult setting, HCWs more frequently reported exposure to COVID-19 patients without PPE (25% vs 15%, P = .046). Report of contacts with children attending out-of-home care facilities dramatically decreased over the study period. Conclusions: Universal masking, reinforcement of hand hygiene, and PPE with medical masks for patients' care allowed protection of HCWs and containment of the outbreak. Residual transmissions were related to persistent exposures with undiagnosed patients or colleagues and not to contacts with children attending out-of-home care facilities.</Abstract>

        <Title>Estimation of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Fatality Rate by Real-time Antibody Screening of Blood Donors Estimation of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Fatality Rate by Real-time Antibody Screening of Blood Donors</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: The pandemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has tremendous consequences for our societies. Knowledge of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is needed to accurately monitor the spread of the epidemic and to calculate the infection fatality rate (IFR). These measures may help the authorities make informed decisions and adjust the current societal interventions. The objective was to perform nationwide real-time seroprevalence surveying among blood donors as a tool to estimate previous SARS-CoV-2 infections and the population-based IFR. Methods: Danish blood donors aged 17-69 years giving blood 6 April to 3 May were tested for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M and G antibodies using a commercial lateral flow test. Antibody status was compared between geographical areas, and an estimate of the IFR was calculated. Seroprevalence was adjusted for assay sensitivity and specificity taking the uncertainties of the test validation into account when reporting the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: The first 20 640 blood donors were tested, and a combined adjusted seroprevalence of 1.9% (95% CI, .8-2.3) was calculated. The seroprevalence differed across areas. Using available data on fatalities and population numbers, a combined IFR in patients &lt;70 years is estimated at 89 per 100 000 (95% CI, 72-211) infections. Conclusions: The IFR was estimated to be slightly lower than previously reported from other countries not using seroprevalence data. The IFR is likely severalfold lower than the current estimate. We have initiated real-time nationwide anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence surveying of blood donations as a tool in monitoring the epidemic.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>The arrival of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the African continent resulted in a range of lockdown measures that curtailed the spread of the infection but caused economic hardship. African countries now face difficult choices regarding easing of lockdowns and sustaining effective public health control measures and surveillance. Pandemic control will require efficient community screening, testing, and contact tracing; behavioral change interventions; adequate resources; and well-supported, community-based teams of trained, protected personnel. We discuss COVID-19 control approaches in selected African countries and the need for shared, affordable, innovative methods to overcome challenges and minimize mortality. This crisis presents a unique opportunity to align COVID-19 services with those already in place for human immunodeficiency virus, tuberculosis, malaria, and non communicable diseases through mobilization of Africa's interprofessional healthcare workforce. By addressing the challenges, the detrimental effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on African citizens can be minimized.</Abstract>

        <Title>First Reported Nosocomial Outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in a Pediatric Dialysis Unit First Reported Nosocomial Outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in a Pediatric Dialysis Unit</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a life-threatening respiratory condition caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and was initially detected in China in December 2019. Currently, in Germany &gt;140 000 cases of COVID-19 are confirmed. Here we report a nosocomial outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the pediatric dialysis unit of the University Hospital Münster (UHM). Methods: Single-step real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs was used to diagnose the index patient and identify infected contacts. Epidemiological links were analyzed by patient interviews and medical record reviews. In addition, each contact was assessed for exposure to the index case and monitored for clinical symptoms. Cycle threshold (Ct) values of all positive test results were compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. Results: Forty-eight cases were involved in this nosocomial outbreak. Nine contact cases developed laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections. Two SARS-CoV-2-positive cases remained clinically asymptomatic. Eleven cases reported flulike symptoms without positive results. Ct values were significantly lower in cases presenting typical COVID-19 symptoms, suggesting high viral shedding (P = .007). Conclusions: Person-to-person transmission was at the heart of a hospital outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 between healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients in the pediatric dialysis unit at UHM. Semiquantitative rRT-PCR results suggest that individuals with high viral load pose a risk to spread SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital setting. Our epidemiological observation highlights the need to develop strategies to trace and monitor SARS-CoV-2-infected HCWs to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks in the hospital setting.</Abstract>

        <Title>Are All Patients with Cancer at Heightened Risk for Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)? Are All Patients with Cancer at Heightened Risk for Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)?</Title>
        <Abstract>Cancer patients are traditionally considered at high risk for complicated respiratory viral infections, due to their underlying immunosuppression. In line with this notion, early case series reported high mortality rates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in patients with malignancy. However, subsequent large, prospective, epidemiological surveys indicate that the risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be largely attributed to the multiple confounders operating in this highly heterogeneous population of patients, rather than the cancer or its treatment per se. We critically discuss the conundrums of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients and underscore mechanistic insights on the outcome of COVID-19 as it relates to cancer therapy and the type and status of the underlying malignancy. Not all cancer patients are similarly at risk for a complicated COVID-19 course. A roadmap is needed for translational and clinical research on COVID-19 in this challenging group of patients.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) have paid a heavy toll during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Routes of transmission remain to be fully understood. Methods: This prospective study compared a 1500-bed adult and 600-bed pediatric setting of a tertiary-care university hospital located in central Paris. From 24 February until 10 April 2020, all symptomatic HCWs were screened for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on a nasopharyngeal swab. HCWs screened positive were questioned on their profession, symptoms, and occupational and nonoccupational exposures to SARS-CoV-2. Results: Among 1344 HCWs tested, 373 were positive (28%) and 336 (90%) corresponding questionnaires were completed. Three hospitalizations and no deaths were reported. Most HCWs (70%) had patient-facing occupational activities (22% in COVID-19 dedicated units). The total number of HCW cases peaked on 23 March, then decreased slowly, concomitantly with a continuous increase of compliance to preventive measures (including universal medical masking and personal protective equipment [PPE] for direct care to COVID-19 patients). Attack rates were of 3.2% and 2.3% in the adult and pediatric settings, respectively (P = .0022). In the adult setting, HCWs more frequently reported exposure to COVID-19 patients without PPE (25% vs 15%, P = .046). Report of contacts with children attending out-of-home care facilities dramatically decreased over the study period. Conclusions: Universal masking, reinforcement of hand hygiene, and PPE with medical masks for patients' care allowed protection of HCWs and containment of the outbreak. Residual transmissions were related to persistent exposures with undiagnosed patients or colleagues and not to contacts with children attending out-of-home care facilities.</Abstract>

        <Title>Magnitude and Kinetics of Anti-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Antibody Responses and Their Relationship to Disease Severity Magnitude and Kinetics of Anti-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Antibody Responses and Their Relationship to Disease Severity</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can be detected indirectly by measuring the host immune response. For some viruses, antibody concentrations correlate with host protection and viral neutralization, but in rare cases, antiviral antibodies can promote disease progression. Elucidation of the kinetics and magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response is essential to understand the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and identify potential therapeutic targets. Methods: Sera (n = 533) from patients with real-time polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 (n = 94 with acute infections and n = 59 convalescent patients) were tested using a high-throughput quantitative immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) assay that detects antibodies to the spike protein receptor binding domain and nucleocapsid protein. Individual and serial samples covered the time of initial diagnosis, during the disease course, and following recovery. We evaluated antibody kinetics and correlation between magnitude of the response and disease severity. Results: Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 antibody production varied considerably. Among 52 patients with 3 or more serial specimens, 44 (84.6%) and 42 (80.8%) had observed IgM and IgG seroconversion at a median of 8 and 10 days, respectively. Compared to those with milder disease, peak measurements were significantly higher for patients admitted to the intensive care unit for all time intervals between 6 and 20 days for IgM, and all intervals after 5 days for IgG. Conclusions: High-sensitivity assays with a robust dynamic range provide a comprehensive picture of host antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. IgM and IgG responses were significantly higher in patients with severe than mild disease. These differences may affect strategies for seroprevalence studies, therapeutics, and vaccine development.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>The epidemic of novel coronavirus disease was first reported in China in late December 2019 and was brought under control after some 2 months in China. However, it has become a global pandemic, and the number of cases and deaths continues to increase outside of China. We describe the emergence of the pandemic, detail the first 100 days of China's response as a phase 1 containment strategy followed by phase 2 containment, and briefly highlight areas of focus for the future. Specific, simple, and pragmatic strategies used in China for risk assessment, prioritization, and deployment of resources are described. Details of implementation, at different risk levels, of the traditional public health interventions are shared. Involvement of society in mounting a whole country response and challenges experienced with logistics and supply chains are described. Finally, the methods China is employing to cautiously restart social life and economic activity are outlined.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created many changes and difficulties in healthcare, and the anesthesia specialty is no exception. Both the increased need for personal protective equipment (PPE) and the potential for infection and contamination through respiratory droplets have been sources of much concern. Policies and protocols have been adapted worldwide to help neutralize infection risk and exposure. Transmission of the virus to healthcare workers has been a major concern, and the risk of infection is exceptionally high for Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) because of their close contact with infected patients. CRNAs are in a unique position to help decrease exposure for themselves and other members of the healthcare team by taking extra precautions during airway manipulation. A great deal of focus has been placed on reducing risks during intubation, but reports describing methods of reducing contamination and exposure to respiratory droplets during emergence and extubation are scarce. The authors have reviewed techniques to reduce coughing, thereby decreasing the potential of virus exposure through contact with large respiratory droplets and aerosolized particles that may remain suspended in air.</Abstract>

        <Title>Review of Anesthesia Versus Intensive Care Unit Ventilators and Ventilatory Strategies: COVID-19 Patient Management Implications Review of Anesthesia Versus Intensive Care Unit Ventilators and Ventilatory Strategies: COVID-19 Patient Management Implications</Title>
        <Abstract>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) respiratory illness has increased the amount of people needing airway rescue and the support of mechanical ventilators. In doing so, the pandemic has increased the demand of healthcare professionals to manage these critically ill individuals. Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs), who are trained experts in airway management and mechanical ventilation with experience in intensive care units (ICUs), rise to this challenge. However, many CRNAs may be unfamiliar with advancements in critical care ventilators. The purpose of this review is to provide a resource for CRNAs returning to the ICU to manage patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. The most common ventilator modes found in anesthesia machine ventilators and ICU ventilators are reviewed, as are the lung-protective ventilation strategies, including positive end-expiratory pressure, used to manage patients with COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome. Adjuncts to mechanical ventilation, recruitment maneuvers, prone positioning, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are also reviewed. More research is needed concerning the management of COVID-19-infected patients, and CRNAs must become familiar with their ICU units' individual ventilator machine, but this brief review provides a good place to start for those returning to the ICU.</Abstract>

        <Title>Psychological and Behavioral Predictors of Vaccine Efficacy: Considerations for COVID-19 Psychological and Behavioral Predictors of Vaccine Efficacy: Considerations for COVID-19</Title>
        <Abstract>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine candidates are being evaluated, with the goal of conferring immunity on the highest percentage of people who receive the vaccine as possible. It is noteworthy that vaccine efficacy depends not only on the vaccine but also on characteristics of the vaccinated. Over the past 30 years, a series of studies has documented the impact of psychological factors on the immune system's vaccine response. Robust evidence has demonstrated that stress, depression, loneliness, and poor health behaviors can impair the immune system's response to vaccines, and this effect may be greatest in vulnerable groups such as the elderly. Psychological factors are also implicated in the prevalence and severity of vaccine-related side effects. These findings have generalized across many vaccine types and therefore may be relevant to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In this review, we discuss these psychological and behavioral risk factors for poor vaccine responses, their relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as targeted psychological and behavioral interventions to boost vaccine efficacy and reduce side effects. Recent data suggest these psychological and behavioral risk factors are highly prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic, but intervention research suggests that psychological and behavioral interventions can increase vaccine efficacy.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>As countries continue to industrialize, major cities experience diminished air quality, while rural populations also experience poor air quality from sources such as agricultural operations. These exposures to environmental pollution from both rural and populated/industrialized sources have adverse effects on human health. Although respiratory diseases (e.g. asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) are the most commonly reported following long-term exposure to particulate matter and hazardous chemicals, gastrointestinal complications have also been associated with the increased risk of lung disease from inhalation of polluted air. The interconnectedness of these organ systems has offered valuable insights into the roles of the immune system and the micro/mycobiota as mediators of communication between the lung and the gut during disease states. A topical example of this relationship is provided by reports of multiple gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), while the rapid transmission and increased risk of COVID-19 has been linked to poor air quality and high levels of particulate matter. In this review, we focus on the mechanistic effects of environmental pollution on disease progression with special emphasis on the gut-lung axis.</Abstract>

        <Title>Clinical significance of coronavirus disease 2019 in hospitalized patients with myocardial injury Clinical significance of coronavirus disease 2019 in hospitalized patients with myocardial injury</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: The clinical significance of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as an associate of myocardial injury is controversial. Hypothesis: Type 2 MI/Myocardial Injury are associated with worse outcomes if complicated by COVID-19. Methods: This longitudinal cohort study involved consecutive patients admitted to a large urban hospital. Myocardial injury was determined using laboratory records as ≥1 hs-TnI result &gt;99th percentile (male: &gt;34 ng/L; female: &gt;16 ng/L). Endotypes were defined according to the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (MI) and COVID-19 determined using PCR. Outcomes of patients with myocardial injury with and without COVID-19 were assessed. Results: Of 346 hospitalized patients with elevated hs-TnI, 35 (10.1%) had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (median age [IQR]; 65 [59-74]; 64.8% male vs. COVID-19 negative: 74 [63-83] years; 43.7% male). Cardiac endotypes by COVID-19 status (yes vs. no) were: Type 1 MI (0 [0%] vs. 115 [100%]; p &lt; .0005), Type 2 MI (13 [16.5%] vs. 66 [83.5%]; p = .045), and non-ischemic myocardial injury (cardiac: 4 [5.8%] vs. 65 [94.2%]; p = .191, non-cardiac:19 [22.9%] vs. 64 [77.%]; p &lt; .0005). COVID-19 patients had less comorbidity (median [IQR] Charlson Comorbidity Index: 3.0 [3.0] vs. 5.0 [4.0]; p = .001), similar hs-TnI concentrations (median [IQR] initial: 46 [113] vs. 62 [138]; p = .199, peak: 122 [474] vs. 79 [220] ng/L; p = .564), longer admission (days) (median [IQR]: 14[19] vs. 6[12]; p = .001) and higher in-hospital mortality (63.9% vs. 11.3%; OR = 13.2; 95%CI: 5.90, 29.7). Conclusions: Cardiac sequelae of COVID-19 typically manifest as Non-cardiac myocardial injury/Type 2MI in younger patients with less co-morbidity. Paradoxically, the admission duration and in-hospital mortality are increased.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Emerging evidence has confirmed meteorological factors and air pollutants affect novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, no studies to date have considered the impact of interactions between meteorological factors and air pollutants on COVID-19 transmission. This study explores the association between ambient air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3), meteorological factors (average temperature, diurnal temperature range, relative humidity, wind velocity, air pressure, precipitation, and hours of sunshine), and their interaction on confirmed case counts of COVID-19 in 120 Chinese cities. We modeled total confirmed cases of COVID-19 as the dependent variable with meteorological factors, air pollutants, and their interactions as the independent variables. To account for potential migration effects, we included the migration scale index (MSI) from Wuhan to each of the 120 cities included in the model, using data from 15 Jan. to 18 Mar. 2020. As an important confounding factor, MSI was considered in a negative binomial regression analysis. Positive associations were found between the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and CO, PM2.5, relative humidity, and O3, with and without MSI-adjustment. Negative associations were also found for SO2 and wind velocity both with and without controlling for population migration. In addition, air pollutants and meteorological factors had interactive effects on COVID-19 after controlling for MSI. In conclusion, air pollutants, meteorological factors, and their interactions all affect COVID-19 cases.</Abstract>

        <Title>[Structure of hospital care for COVID-19 patients up to July 2020 in Germany] [Structure of hospital care for COVID-19 patients up to July 2020 in Germany]</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: Hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have a high morbidity and mortality and are often dependent on intensive care, especially mechanical ventilation. Little is as yet known about COVID-19 patient allocation. Objectives: Analysis of the structures of German hospital care for COVID-19 patients up to July 2020 in terms of number of beds and previous ventilation experience. Data and methods: For the analysis of the care structures, only completed COVID-19 cases in which the virus was detected by a PCR test were evaluated. Claims data from the German Local Health Care Funds (Allgemeine Ortskrankenkassen, AOK) were analysed. The sample includes 17,094 COVID-19 cases that were treated in 1082 hospitals. Results: A total of 77% of all hospitals participated in the treatment COVID-19 patients and 48% of all hospitals provided intensive care for these patients. One half of the hospitals that treated COVID-19 cases cared for 88% of all cases. Although this suggests a centralization effect of COVID-19 cases in specific hospitals, the remaining 12% of the cases were distributed among many hospitals with often very small numbers of cases. Furthermore, 23% of the ventilated COVID-19 cases were treated in hospitals with below-average ventilation experience. Conclusions: In the context of increasing numbers of infections, it is both necessary to improve the allocation of hospitalized, and therefore potentially ventilated, COVID-19 cases by means of clearly defined and centrally controlled pyramid-type concepts and to continue to care for patients without COVID-19. For Germany, a comprehensive pyramid-type concept with a greater concentration in the best-qualified hospitals seems reasonable for the care of these patients with complex diseases.</Abstract>

        <Title>18 F-FDG brain PET hypometabolism in patients with long COVID 18 F-FDG brain PET hypometabolism in patients with long COVID</Title>
        <Abstract>Purpose: In the context of the worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), some patients report functional complaints after apparent recovery from COVID-19. This clinical presentation has been referred as "long COVID." We here present a retrospective analysis of 18F-FDG brain PET of long COVID patients from the same center with a biologically confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and persistent functional complaints at least 3 weeks after the initial infection. Methods: PET scans of 35 patients with long COVID were compared using whole-brain voxel-based analysis to a local database of 44 healthy subjects controlled for age and sex to characterize cerebral hypometabolism. The individual relevance of this metabolic profile was evaluated to classify patients and healthy subjects. Finally, the PET abnormalities were exploratory compared with the patients' characteristics and functional complaints. Results: In comparison to healthy subjects, patients with long COVID exhibited bilateral hypometabolism in the bilateral rectal/orbital gyrus, including the olfactory gyrus; the right temporal lobe, including the amygdala and the hippocampus, extending to the right thalamus; the bilateral pons/medulla brainstem; the bilateral cerebellum (p-voxel &lt; 0.001 uncorrected, p-cluster &lt; 0.05 FWE-corrected). These metabolic clusters were highly discriminant to distinguish patients and healthy subjects (100% correct classification). These clusters of hypometabolism were significantly associated with more numerous functional complaints (brainstem and cerebellar clusters), and all associated with the occurrence of certain symptoms (hyposmia/anosmia, memory/cognitive impairment, pain and insomnia) (p &lt; 0.05). In a more preliminary analysis, the metabolism of the frontal cluster which included the olfactory gyrus was worse in the 7 patients treated by ACE drugs for high blood pressure (p = 0.032), and better in the 3 patients that had used nasal decongestant spray at the infectious stage (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: This study demonstrates a profile of brain PET hypometabolism in long COVID patients with biologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and persistent functional complaints more than 3 weeks after the initial infection symptoms, involving the olfactory gyrus and connected limbic/paralimbic regions, extended to the brainstem and the cerebellum. These hypometabolisms are associated with patients' symptoms, with a biomarker value to identify and potentially follow these patients. The hypometabolism of the frontal cluster, which included the olfactory gyrus, seems to be linked to ACE drugs in patients with high blood pressure, with also a better metabolism of this olfactory region in patients using nasal decongestant spray, suggesting a possible role of ACE receptors as an olfactory gateway for this neurotropism.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Context.—: During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, several studies have described a distinctive cutaneous manifestation with a clinical picture resembling chilblains or chilblain lupus in young patients. Objective.—: To report the histopathologic description of a series of chilblainlike lesions appearing in the context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 epidemic. Design.—: The study included 13 patients with cutaneous acral lesions resembling chilblains occurring in the setting of suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection with available skin biopsy. Results.—: Two main histopathologic patterns were observed: a chilblainlike histopathologic pattern (10 of 13 cases; 77%) and a thrombotic vasculopathy pattern (3 of 13 cases; 23%). The chilblainlike histopathologic pattern featured a superficial and deep perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes of varying intensity. This infiltrate was sometimes peri-eccrine and alterations of eccrine glands were present in most cases. Vacuolar alteration of the basal layer of the epidermis was found in a majority of patients. Lichenoid interface dermatitis was rarely present. The thrombotic vasculopathy pattern featured an absent or mild inflammatory infiltrate, multiple intraluminal fibrin thrombi, and ischemic epidermal necrosis. In both patterns, no true vasculitis was observed. No patient tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by polymerase chain reaction, possibly because these lesions may represent late cutaneous manifestations of the disease or are associated with an early effective immune response. Conclusions.—: The relationship of chilblainlike lesions to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 requires further investigations. Histopathologic features mimic chilblains, chilblain lupus, and, less frequently, a thrombotic vasculopathy. Response to viral infection might trigger diverse mechanisms leading to the 2 histopathologic patterns described.</Abstract>

        <Title>Endothelial cell-activating antibodies in COVID-19 Endothelial cell-activating antibodies in COVID-19</Title>
        <Abstract>Patients with coronavirus disease 19 ( COVID-19 ) are at high risk for fibrin-based occlusion of vascular beds of all sizes. Although endothelial cell activation has regularly been described as part of the COVID-19 thrombo-inflammatory storm, the upstream mediators of this activation have yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we began by pursuing the hypothesis that circulating factors such as neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) remnants, D-dimer, or C-reactive protein might predict the COVID-19 serum samples (n=118) that most robustly activated cultured endothelial cells. Indeed, we found modest correlations between serum NET remnants (cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes, citrullinated histone H3) and upregulation of surface E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 on endothelial cells. However, a more robust predictor of the ability of COVID-19 serum to activate endothelial cells was the presence of circulating antiphospholipid antibodies, specifically anticardiolipin IgG and IgM and anti-phosphatidlyserine/prothrombin (anti-PS/PT) IgG and IgM. Depletion of total IgG from anticardiolipin-high and anti-PS/PT-high samples markedly restrained upregulation of E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1. At the same time, supplementation of control serum with patient IgG was sufficient to trigger endothelial cell activation. These data are the first to reveal that patient antibodies are a driver of endothelial cell activation and add important context regarding thrombo-inflammatory effects of COVID-19 autoantibodies in severe COVID-19.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>The current COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 19) pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, disproportionally affects the elderly and people with comorbidities like obesity and associated type 2 diabetes mellitus. Small animal models are crucial for the successful development and validation of antiviral vaccines, therapies and to study the role that comorbidities have on the outcome of viral infections. The initially available SARS-CoV-2 isolates require adaptation in order to use the mouse angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (mACE-2) entry receptor and to productively infect the cells of the murine respiratory tract. We have "mouse-adapted" SARS-CoV-2 by serial passaging a clinical virus isolate in the lungs of mice. We then used low doses of this virus in mouse models for advanced age, diabetes and obesity. Similar to SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, the outcome of infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 resulted in enhanced morbidity in aged and diabetic obese mice. Mutations associated with mouse adaptation occurred in the S, M, N and ORF8 genes. Interestingly, one mutation in the receptor binding domain of the S protein results in the change of an asparagine to tyrosine residue at position 501 (N501Y). This mutation is also present in the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant viruses reported in the U.K. (20B/501Y.V1, B1.1.7 lineage) that is epidemiologically associated with high human to human transmission. We show that human convalescent and post vaccination sera can neutralize the newly emerging N501Y virus variant with similar efficiency as that of the reference USA-WA1/2020 virus, suggesting that current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will protect against the 20B/501Y.V1 strain.</Abstract>

        <Title>Severity Prediction for COVID-19 Patients via Recurrent Neural Networks Severity Prediction for COVID-19 Patients via Recurrent Neural Networks</Title>
        <Abstract>The novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has threatened the health of tens of millions of people worldwide and imposed heavy burden on global healthcare systems. In this paper, we propose a model to predict whether a patient infected with COVID-19 will develop severe outcomes based only on the patient's historical electronic health records (EHR) prior to hospital admission using recurrent neural networks. The model predicts risk score that represents the probability for a patient to progress into severe status (mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, or death) after being infected with COVID-19. The model achieved 0.846 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in predicting patients' outcomes averaged over 5-fold cross validation. While many of the existing models use features obtained after diagnosis of COVID-19, our proposed model only utilizes a patient's historical EHR to enable proactive risk management at the time of hospital admission.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Background: Accurate detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is necessary to mitigate the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, the test reagents and assay platforms are varied and may not be sufficiently robust to diagnose COVID-19. Methods: We reviewed 85 studies (21,530 patients), published from five regions of the world, to highlight issues involved in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the early phase of the pandemic, following the standards outlined in the PRISMA statement. All relevant articles, published up to May 31, 2020, in PubMed, BioRiXv, MedRiXv, and Google Scholar, were included. We evaluated the qualitative (9749 patients) and quantitative (10,355 patients) performance of RT-PCR and serologic diagnostic tests for real-world samples, and assessed the concordance (5,538 patients) between methods in meta-analyses. Results: The RT-PCR tests exhibited heterogeneity in the primers and reagents used. Of 1,957 positive RT-PCR COVID-19 participants, 1,585 had positive serum antibody (IgM +/- IgG) tests (sensitivity 0.81, 95%CI 0.66-.90). While 3,509 of 3581 participants RT-PCR negative for COVID-19 were found negative by serology testing (specificity 0.98, 95%CI 0.94-0.99). The chemiluminescent immunoassay exhibited the highest sensitivity, followed by ELISA and lateral flow immunoassays. Serology tests had higher sensitivity and specificity for laboratory-approval than for real-world reporting data. Conclusions: The robustness of the assays/platforms is influenced by variability in sampling and reagents. Serological testing complements and may minimize false negative RT-PCR results. Lack of standardized assay protocols in the early phase of pandemic might have contributed to the spread of COVID-19.</Abstract>

Objectives: Develop an individualized prognostic risk prediction tool for predicting the probability of adverse COVID-19 outcomes in patients with IBD. Design setting and participants: This study developed and validated prognostic penalized logistic regression models 4 using reports to Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (SECURE-IBD) from March-October 2020. Model development was done using a training data set (85% of cases reported March 13 - September 15, 2020), and model validation was conducted using a test data set (the remaining 15% of cases plus all cases reported September 16-October 20, 2020). Main outcomes and measures: COVID-19 related:Hospitalization+: composite outcome of hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or deathICU+: composite outcome of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or deathDeathWe assessed the resulting models' discrimination using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves and reported the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: We included 2709 cases from 59 countries (mean age 41.2 years [s.d. 18], 50.2% male). A total of 633 (24%) were hospitalized, 137 (5%) were admitted to the ICU or intubated, and 69 (3%) died. 2009 patients comprised the training set and 700 the test set.The models demonstrated excellent discrimination, with a test set AUC (95% CI) of 0.79 (0.75, 0.83) for Hospitalization+, 0.88 (0.82, 0.95) for ICU+, and 0.94 (0.89, 0.99) for Death. Age, comorbidities, corticosteroid use, and male gender were associated with higher risk of death, while use of biologic therapies was associated with a lower risk. Conclusions and relevance: Prognostic models can effectively predict who is at higher risk for COVID-19-related adverse outcomes in a population of IBD patients. A free online risk calculator ( https://covidibd.org/covid-19-risk-calculator/ ) is available for healthcare providers to facilitate discussion of risks due to COVID-19 with IBD patients. The tool numerically and visually summarizes the patient's probabilities of adverse outcomes and associated CIs. Helping physicians identify their highest-risk patients will be important in the coming months as cases rise in the US and worldwide. This tool can also serve as a model for risk stratification in other chronic diseases. Key points: Question: How well can a multivariable risk model predict the risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, or death due to COVID-19 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?Findings: Multivariable prediction models developed using data from an international voluntary registry of IBD patients and available for use online ( https://covidibd.org/ ) have very good discrimination for predicting hospitalization (Test set AUC 0.79) and excellent discrimination for ICU admission (Test set AUC 0.88) and death (Test set AUC 0.94). The models were developed with a training sample of 2009 cases and validated in an independent test sample of 700 cases comprised of a random sub-sample of cases and all cases entered in the registry during a one-month period after model development. Meaning: This risk prediction model may serve as an effective tool for healthcare providers to facilitate conversations about COVID-19-related risks with IBD patients.</Abstract>

        <Title>High-throughput sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater provides insights into circulating variants High-throughput sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater provides insights into circulating variants</Title>
        <Abstract>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from a zoonotic spill-over event and has led to a global pandemic. The public health response has been predominantly informed by surveillance of symptomatic individuals and contact tracing, with quarantine, and other preventive measures have then been applied to mitigate further spread. Non-traditional methods of surveillance such as genomic epidemiology and wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) have also been leveraged during this pandemic. Genomic epidemiology uses high-throughput sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to inform local and international transmission events, as well as the diversity of circulating variants. WBE uses wastewater to analyse community spread, as it is known that SARS-CoV-2 is shed through bodily excretions. Since both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals contribute to wastewater inputs, we hypothesized that the resultant pooled sample of population-wide excreta can provide a more comprehensive picture of SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity circulating in a community than clinical testing and sequencing alone. In this study, we analysed 91 wastewater samples from 11 states in the USA, where the majority of samples represent Maricopa County, Arizona (USA). With the objective of assessing the viral diversity at a population scale, we undertook a single-nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis on data from 52 samples with &gt;90% SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage of sequence reads, and compared these SNVs with those detected in genomes sequenced from clinical patients. We identified 7973 SNVs, of which 5680 were novel SNVs that had not yet been identified in the global clinical-derived data as of 17th June 2020 (the day after our last wastewater sampling date). However, between 17th of June 2020 and 20th November 2020, almost half of the SNVs have since been detected in clinical-derived data. Using the combination of SNVs present in each sample, we identified the more probable lineages present in that sample and compared them to lineages observed in North America prior to our sampling dates. The wastewater-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequence data indicates there were more lineages circulating across the sampled communities than represented in the clinical-derived data. Principal coordinate analyses identified patterns in population structure based on genetic variation within the sequenced samples, with clear trends associated with increased diversity likely due to a higher number of infected individuals relative to the sampling dates. We demonstrate that genetic correlation analysis combined with SNVs analysis using wastewater sampling can provide a comprehensive snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic population structure circulating within a community, which might not be observed if relying solely on clinical cases.</Abstract>

        <Title>mRNA vaccine-elicited antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and circulating variants mRNA vaccine-elicited antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and circulating variants</Title>
        <Abstract>To date severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected nearly 100 million individuals resulting in over two million deaths. Many vaccines are being deployed to prevent coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) including two novel mRNA-based vaccines 1,2 . These vaccines elicit neutralizing antibodies and appear to be safe and effective, but the precise nature of the elicited antibodies is not known 3-5 . Here we report on the antibody and memory B cell responses in a cohort of 20 volunteers who received either the Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccines. Consistent with prior reports, 8 weeks after the second vaccine injection volunteers showed high levels of IgM, and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S), receptor binding domain (RBD) binding titers 3,5 . Moreover, the plasma neutralizing activity, and the relative numbers of RBD-specific memory B cells were equivalent to individuals who recovered from natural infection 6,7 . However, activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants encoding E484K or N501Y or the K417N:E484K:N501Y combination was reduced by a small but significant margin. Consistent with these findings, vaccine-elicited monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2, targeting a number of different RBD epitopes epitopes in common with mAbs isolated from infected donors. Structural analyses of mAbs complexed with S trimer suggest that vaccine- and virus-encoded S adopts similar conformations to induce equivalent anti-RBD antibodies. However, neutralization by 14 of the 17 most potent mAbs tested was reduced or abolished by either K417N, or E484K, or N501Y mutations. Notably, the same mutations were selected when recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)/SARS-CoV-2 S was cultured in the presence of the vaccine elicited mAbs. Taken together the results suggest that the monoclonal antibodies in clinical use should be tested against newly arising variants, and that mRNA vaccines may need to be updated periodically to avoid potential loss of clinical efficacy.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>The ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to exert a significant burden on health care systems worldwide. With limited treatments available, vaccination remains an effective strategy to counter transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent discussions concerning vaccination strategies have focused on identifying vaccine platforms, number of doses, route of administration, and time to reach peak immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we generated a single dose, fast-acting vesicular stomatitis virus-based vaccine derived from the licensed Ebola virus (EBOV) vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV, expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the EBOV glycoprotein (VSV-SARS2-EBOV). Rhesus macaques vaccinated intramuscularly (IM) with a single dose of VSV-SARS2-EBOV were protected within 10 days and did not show signs of COVID-19 pneumonia. In contrast, intranasal (IN) vaccination resulted in limited immunogenicity and enhanced COVID-19 pneumonia compared to control animals. While IM and IN vaccination both induced neutralizing antibody titers, only IM vaccination resulted in a significant cellular immune response. RNA sequencing data bolstered these results by revealing robust activation of the innate and adaptive immune transcriptional signatures in the lungs of IM-vaccinated animals only. Overall, the data demonstrates that VSV-SARS2-EBOV is a potent single-dose COVID-19 vaccine candidate that offers rapid protection based on the protective efficacy observed in our study. One sentence summary: VSV vaccine protects NHPs from COVID-19 in 10 days.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2, a novel lineage of the coronavirus causing COVID-19, contains multiple mutations within two immunodominant domains of the spike protein. Here we show that this lineage exhibits complete escape from three classes of therapeutically relevant monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore 501Y.V2 shows substantial or complete escape from neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 convalescent plasma. These data highlight the prospect of reinfection with antigenically distinct variants and may foreshadow reduced efficacy of current spike-based vaccines.</Abstract>

        <Title>mRNA-1273 vaccine induces neutralizing antibodies against spike mutants from global SARS-CoV-2 variants mRNA-1273 vaccine induces neutralizing antibodies against spike mutants from global SARS-CoV-2 variants</Title>
        <Abstract>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative infection of a global pandemic that has led to more than 2 million deaths worldwide. The Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine has demonstrated ~94% efficacy in a Phase 3 study and has been approved under Emergency Use Authorization. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the spike protein, most recently circulating isolates from the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7) and Republic of South Africa (B.1.351), has led to lower neutralization from convalescent serum by pseudovirus neutralization (PsVN) assays and resistance to certain monoclonal antibodies. Here, using two orthogonal VSV and lentivirus PsVN assays expressing spike variants of 20E (EU1), 20A.EU2, D614G-N439, mink cluster 5, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351 variants, we assessed the neutralizing capacity of sera from human subjects or non-human primates (NHPs) that received mRNA-1273. No significant impact on neutralization against the B.1.1.7 variant was detected in either case, however reduced neutralization was measured against the mutations present in B.1.351. Geometric mean titer (GMT) of human sera from clinical trial participants in VSV PsVN assay using D614G spike was 1/1852. VSV pseudoviruses with spike containing K417N-E484K-N501Y-D614G and full B.1.351 mutations resulted in 2.7 and 6.4-fold GMT reduction, respectively, when compared to the D614G VSV pseudovirus. Importantly, the VSV PsVN GMT of these human sera to the full B.1.351 spike variant was still 1/290, with all evaluated sera able to fully neutralize. Similarly, sera from NHPs immunized with 30 or 100μg of mRNA-1273 had VSV PsVN GMTs of ~ 1/323 or 1/404, respectively, against the full B.1.351 spike variant with a ~ 5 to 10-fold reduction compared to D614G. Individual mutations that are characteristic of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants had a similar impact on neutralization when tested in VSV or in lentivirus PsVN assays. Despite the observed decreases, the GMT of VSV PsVN titers in human vaccinee sera against the B.1.351 variant remained at ~1/300. Taken together these data demonstrate reduced but still significant neutralization against the full B.1.351 variant following mRNA-1273 vaccination.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Comparative functional analysis of the binding interactions between various Betacoronavirus mutant strains and their potential multiple human target proteins is crucial for a more complete understanding of zoonotic spillovers of viruses that cause diseases like COVID-19. Here, employing hundreds of replicate sets of nanosecond scale GPU accelerated molecular dynamics simulations, we statistically compare atom motions of ACE2 and CD26 target proteins in both the presence and absence of different strains of the viral receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S spike glycoprotein. In all strains, we demonstrate a universally conserved functional binding signature of the viral RBD with the N-terminal helices of ACE2. We also identify a second more dynamically transient interaction of the viral N501 with the previously confirmed ACE2 K353 and two nearby novel sites, Q325 and the AAQPFLL 386-92 motif. We propose a model of the functional evolution of SARS-type zoonotic spillovers involving both (A) a conserved binding interaction with the N-terminal helices of ACE2 that is preadapted from viral interaction of the Tylonycteris bat coronavirus progenitor strain HKU4 with the SAMLI 291-5 motif in protein CD26 and (B) a more promiscuous and likely more evolvable interaction between viral N501 and the above-mentioned multiple regions of ACE2 that is preadapted from the bat viral interaction at the CD26 SS 333-4 motif. Our recent analysis of the highly transmissible N501Y lineage B.1.1.7 mutation in SARS-CoV-2 also supports this model, identifying a less promiscuous Y501 interaction with ACE2 that favors more stable functional binding with the K353 site alone.</Abstract>

        <Title>Host-directed therapies against early-lineage SARS-CoV-2 retain efficacy against B.1.1.7 variant Host-directed therapies against early-lineage SARS-CoV-2 retain efficacy against B.1.1.7 variant</Title>
        <Abstract>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in millions of deaths worldwide and massive societal and economic burden. Recently, a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, known as B.1.1.7, was first detected in the United Kingdom and is spreading in several other countries, heightening public health concern and raising questions as to the resulting effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutic interventions. We and others previously identified host-directed therapies with antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Less prone to the development of therapy resistance, host-directed drugs represent promising therapeutic options to combat emerging viral variants as host genes possess a lower propensity to mutate compared to viral genes. Here, in the first study of the full-length B.1.1.7 variant virus, we find two host-directed drugs, plitidepsin (aplidin; inhibits translation elongation factor eEF1A) and ralimetinib (inhibits p38 MAP kinase cascade), as well as remdesivir, to possess similar antiviral activity against both the early-lineage SARS-CoV-2 and the B.1.1.7 variant, evaluated in both human gastrointestinal and lung epithelial cell lines. We find that plitidepsin is over an order of magnitude more potent than remdesivir against both viruses. These results highlight the importance of continued development of host-directed therapeutics to combat current and future coronavirus variant outbreaks.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>The biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) requirement to culture severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a bottleneck for research and countermeasure development. Here we report a trans -complementation system that produces single-round infectious SARS-CoV-2 that recapitulates authentic viral replication. We demonstrate that the single-round infectious SARS-CoV-2 can be used at BSL-2 laboratories for high-throughput neutralization and antiviral testing. The trans -complementation system consists of two components: a genomic viral RNA containing a deletion of ORF3 and envelope gene, and a producer cell line expressing the two deleted genes. Trans- complementation of the two components generates virions that can infect naive cells for only one round, but does not produce wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Hamsters and K18-hACE2 transgenic mice inoculated with the complementation-derived virions exhibited no detectable disease, even after intracranial inoculation with the highest possible dose. The results suggest that the trans -complementation platform can be safely used at BSL-2 laboratories for research and countermeasure development.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Neutralizing antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) are among the most promising approaches against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 1,2 . We developed a bispecific, IgG1-like molecule based on two antibodies derived from COVID-19 convalescent donors, C121 and C135 3 . CoV-X2 simultaneously binds two independent sites on the RBD and, unlike its parental antibodies, completely prevents S binding to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the virus cellular receptor. Furthermore, CoV-X2 recognizes a broad panel of RBD variants and neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and the escape mutants generated by the single monoclonals at sub-nanomolar concentrations. In a novel model of SARS-CoV-2 infection with lung inflammation, CoV-X2 protects mice from disease and suppresses viral escape. Thus, simultaneous targeting of non-overlapping RBD epitopes by IgG-like bispecific antibodies is feasible and effective, combining into a single molecule the advantages of antibody cocktails.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Background: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected individuals as well as disease-specific brain tumor organizations. These organizations around the world exist to address unmet needs for patients and caregivers they serve. The direct impact of the pandemic on these organizations constitutes significant collateral damage. In order to better understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on brain tumor organizations, the International Brain Tumour Alliance (IBTA) carried out an international survey to identify organizational changes induced by the virus and approaches adopted to address challenges. Methods: A 37-question online survey consisting of categorical and qualitative questions was developed and circulated to 130 brain tumor organizations across the world. Seventy-seven organizations from 22 countries completed the survey (59% return rate). Descriptive statistics and content analysis were used to present the results. Results: Responses fell into the following 3 categories: (1) organizational characteristics, (2) impact of COVID-19 on services, and (3) COVID-19 impact on financial and human resources within organizations. Although organizational characteristics varied, common concerns reported were activity disruption which impacted organizations' abilities to offer usual services and challenges to sustaining funding. Both financial and human resources were stressed, but integral adaptations were made by organizations to preserve resources during the pandemic. Conclusions: Although brain tumor organizations have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, organizations quickly adjusted to this unprecedented global healthcare crisis. Nimble reactions and flexibility have been vital to organization sustainability. Innovative approaches are required to ensure organizations remain viable so that needs of brain tumor community at large are met.</Abstract>

        <Title>The neurological manifestations of COVID-19 - A case series The neurological manifestations of COVID-19 - A case series</Title>
        <Abstract>Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a fatal respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus (CoV). The first known case was reported in 2002, later coined as SARS-CoV. Over the last two decades, the CoV has periodically emerged in the general population, causing a varying degree of pneumonia. The most recent outbreak, now known as coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), has been on an exponential rise. Similar to its predecessors, COVID-19 causes a fatal form of pneumonia; however, in a small percentage of patients, COVID-19 has shown to cause neurological symptoms. Given that SARS-CoV and the new CoV strain share similar viral structures, COVID-19 may have the capability to invade the neurological system. We present a series of patients with COVID-19, the first of which presented with a seizure, whereas our second patient developed seizures during their hospital course. Neither patient had a previous history of epilepsy. Relevance for patients: COVID-19 has rapidly evolved since it was first reported and has proven to be a fatal infective process. The last several months have been challenging for the medical community as we try to understand the complexities of this virus. Clinicians have attempted to assess the most common presenting symptoms based on reported cases. The purpose of this study was to help understand how COVID-19 presents itself when the neurological system is involved. This case series describes the common and uncommon neurological manifestations of COVID-19. By doing so, we hope to provide clinicians with additional information to help diagnose COVID-19 in this unprecedented time and to also be wary of the uncommon presenting features.</Abstract>

        <Title>Predicting thromboembolic complications in COVID-19 ICU patients using machine learning Predicting thromboembolic complications in COVID-19 ICU patients using machine learning</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a challenge for intensive care units (ICU) in part due to the failure to identify risks for patients early and the inability to render an accurate prognosis. Previous reports suggest a strong association between hypercoagulability and poor outcome. Factors related to hemostasis may, therefore, serve as tools to improve the management of COVID-19 patients. Aim: The purpose of this report is to develop a model to determine whether it is possible to early identify COVID-19 patients at risk for thromboembolic complications (TCs). Methods: We analyzed electronic health record data of 108 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to the adult ICU of the Erasmus University Medical Center between February 27 and May 20, 2020. By training a decision tree classifier on 66% of the available data, a model for the prediction of TCs was developed. Results: The median (interquartile range) age was 62 (53-70) years and 73% were male. Forty-three patients (40%) developed a TC during their ICU stay. Mortality was higher for patients in the TCs group compared to the control group (26% vs. 8%, P=0.03). Lactate dehydrogenase, standardized bicarbonate, albumin, and leukocytes were identified by the Decision Tree classifier as the most powerful predictors for TCs 2 days before the onset of the TC, with a sensitivity of 73% and a positive likelihood ratio of 2.7 on the test dataset. Conclusions: Clinically relevant TCs frequently occur in critically ill COVID-19 patients. These can successfully be predicted using a decision tree model. Although this model could be of special importance to aid clinical decision making, its generalizability and clinical impact should be determined in a larger population. Relevance for patients: Recently, severe TCs were observed in COVID-19 patients with progressive respiratory failure warranting ICU treatment. Timely identification of patients at risk of developing TCs is critical inasmuch as it would enable clinicians to initiate potentially salvaging therapeutic anticoagulation.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in public health interventions such as physical distancing restrictions to limit the spread and transmission of the novel coronavirus, causing significant effects on the delivery of physical healthcare procedures worldwide. The unprecedented pandemic spurs strong demand for intelligent robotic systems in healthcare. In particular, medical telerobotic systems can play a positive role in the provision of telemedicine to both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. Different from typical studies on medical teleoperation that consider problems such as time delay and information loss in long-distance communication, this survey addresses the consequences of physiological organ motion when using teleoperation systems to create physical distancing between clinicians and patients in the COVID-19 era. We focus on the control-theoretic approaches that have been developed to address inherent robot control issues associated with organ motion. The state-of-the-art telerobotic systems and their applications in COVID-19 healthcare delivery are reviewed, and possible future directions are outlined.</Abstract>

        <Title>Exploring the Applicability of Robot-Assisted UV Disinfection in Radiology Exploring the Applicability of Robot-Assisted UV Disinfection in Radiology</Title>
        <Abstract>The importance of infection control procedures in hospital radiology departments has become increasingly apparent in recent months as the impact of COVID-19 has spread across the world. Existing disinfectant procedures that rely on the manual application of chemical-based disinfectants are time consuming, resource intensive and prone to high degrees of human error. Alternative non-touch disinfection methods, such as Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation (UVGI), have the potential to overcome many of the limitations of existing approaches while significantly improving workflow and equipment utilization. The aim of this research was to investigate the germicidal effectiveness and the practical feasibility of using a robotic UVGI device for disinfecting surfaces in a radiology setting. We present the design of a robotic UVGI platform that can be deployed alongside human workers and can operate autonomously within cramped rooms, thereby addressing two important requirements necessary for integrating the technology within radiology settings. In one hospital, we conducted experiments in a CT and X-ray room. In a second hospital, we investigated the germicidal performance of the robot when deployed to disinfect a CT room in &lt;15 minutes, a period which is estimated to be 2-4 times faster than current practice for disinfecting rooms after infectious (or potentially infectious) patients. Findings from both test sites show that UVGI successfully inactivated all of measurable microbial load on 22 out of 24 surfaces. On the remaining two surfaces, UVGI reduced the microbial load by 84 and 95%, respectively. The study also exposes some of the challenges of manually disinfecting radiology suites, revealing high concentrations of microbial load in hard-to-reach places. Our findings provide compelling evidence that UVGI can effectively inactivate microbes on commonly touched surfaces in radiology suites, even if they were only exposed to relatively short bursts of irradiation. Despite the short irradiation period, we demonstrated the ability to inactivate microbes with more complex cell structures and requiring higher UV inactivation energies than SARS-CoV-2, thus indicating high likelihood of effectiveness against coronavirus.</Abstract>

        <Title>Perspective on therapeutic and diagnostic potential of camel nanobodies for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) Perspective on therapeutic and diagnostic potential of camel nanobodies for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)</Title>
        <Abstract>In this paper, we focus on the camelid nanobodies as a revolutionary therapy that can guide efforts to discover new drugs for Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The small size property makes nanobodies capable of penetrating efficiently into tissues and recognizing cryptic antigens. Strong antigen affinity and stability in the gastrointestinal tract allow them to be used via oral administration. In fact, the use of nanobodies as inhalant can be directly delivered to the target organ, conferring high pulmonary drug concentrations and low systemic drug concentrations and minimal systemic side effects. For that, nanobodies are referred as a class of next-generation antibodies. Nanobodies permit the construction of multivalent formats that may achieve ultra-high neutralization potency and then may prevent mutational escape and can neutralize a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Due to their distinctive characteristics, nanobodies can be of great use in the development of promising treatment or preventive strategies against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this review, the state-of-the-art of camel nanobodies design strategies against the virus including SARS-CoV-2 are critically summarized. The application of general nanotechnology was also discussed to mitigate and control emerging SARS-CoV-2 infection.</Abstract>

        <Title>Persistent Cortical Blindness Following Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) as a Complication of COVID-19 Pneumonia Persistent Cortical Blindness Following Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) as a Complication of COVID-19 Pneumonia</Title>
        <Abstract>The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic emerged in China in December 2019. Since then, there have been growing reports of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases with neurological involvement. We present a case of a 54-year-old woman who presented with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, complicated by a prolonged intensive care stay and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). This resulted in persistent cortical blindness (Anton's syndrome). PRES has only rarely been reported in relation to SARS-CoV-2 infection and no patients have developed persistent cortical blindness. We summarise the clinical presentation of the patient and review the current literature.</Abstract>

        <Title>Delayed definitive treatment of life-threatening neurosurgery patient with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 infection in the midst of pandemic: Report of two cases Delayed definitive treatment of life-threatening neurosurgery patient with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 infection in the midst of pandemic: Report of two cases</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected global health system; in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, both surgeon and anesthesiologist often dealt with emergency situation, optimal timing of surgery and safety protocol in hospital setting must be implemented with many facets for both patients and health-care providers. Case description: We reported two cases. Case#1 - A 16-year-old male was referred to our hospital, due to a decreased of consciousness following a motor vehicle accident. Head CT scan revealed an epidural hemorrhage on the left temporoparietal. The patient was suspected for having COVID-19 from the reactivity of his serum against SARS-CoV-2 antigen. Procedures for the confirmation of COVID-19 and surgical preparation caused 12 h delayed from the admission. Nevertheless, the patient was deteriorated clinically before he was transported to the operating room and died after 6 cycles of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Case#2 - A 25-year-old male was referred to RSHS, due to a decreased of consciousness, diagnosed as bilateral proximal shunt exposed with suspected COVID-19; delay occurred due to unavailability of negative pressure intensive unit for postoperative care. This caused 5760 h (4 days) delayed for bilateral shunt removal and temporary extraventricular drainage. Conclusion: Optimal timing of surgery, a good safety, and health protocol during pandemic in emergency setting are an obligation to protect health providers and patients. A decision-making plan must be organized precisely to maintain alertness, achieve the highest possible standard of care, and outcome in emergency surgical cases. Lack of monitoring must be abated to avoid fatality for patient, especially in emergency surgery setting.</Abstract>

        <Title>Innovative overhead transparent plastic barrier with powered suction technique intended to limit coronavirus disease 2019 aerosols spread during fiber-optic intubation and throughout the surgery Innovative overhead transparent plastic barrier with powered suction technique intended to limit coronavirus disease 2019 aerosols spread during fiber-optic intubation and throughout the surgery</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: In the context of the current coronavirus pandemic, we propose an inexpensive, innovative overhead transparent plastic barrier with powered suction (OTPBPS) technique using materials that are ubiquitous in the hospital, easy to set up in minutes and well tolerated by the patients. As presented in this case report, it is an effective method to reduce viral spread from patients with positive or suspected yet unconfirmed coronavirus disease 2019 status. Case description: A 49-year-old male was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of cervical stenosis and a C6-C7 disc herniation with spinal cord compression. The OTPBPS technique was set up to create a negative pressure environment around the patient's head, using a Mayo stand, a transparent plastic bag, and powered wall canister suction. The neurosurgeon successfully performed an anterior cervical discectomy and instrumented fusion under OTPBPS. The patient was satisfied with the intubation and anesthetic management and reported excellent feedback. Conclusion: The OTPBPS technique helps control the spread of an aerosolized viral load from the patient's mouth or airway during awake fiber-optic intubation. This technique will help anesthesiologists and other front-line health-care providers manage copious endotracheal secretions and droplet particles, which have an immense infectious potential.</Abstract>

        <Title>Synonymous mutations and the molecular evolution of SARS-CoV-2 origins Synonymous mutations and the molecular evolution of SARS-CoV-2 origins</Title>
        <Abstract>Human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is most closely related, by average genetic distance, to two coronaviruses isolated from bats, RaTG13 and RmYN02. However, there is a segment of high amino acid similarity between human SARS-CoV-2 and a pangolin-isolated strain, GD410721, in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, a pattern that can be caused by either recombination or by convergent amino acid evolution driven by natural selection. We perform a detailed analysis of the synonymous divergence, which is less likely to be affected by selection than amino acid divergence, between human SARS-CoV-2 and related strains. We show that the synonymous divergence between the bat-derived viruses and SARS-CoV-2 is larger than between GD410721 and SARS-CoV-2 in the RBD, providing strong additional support for the recombination hypothesis. However, the synonymous divergence between pangolin strain and SARS-CoV-2 is also relatively high, which is not consistent with a recent recombination between them, instead, it suggests a recombination into RaTG13. We also find a 14-fold increase in the dN /dS ratio from the lineage leading to SARS-CoV-2 to the strains of the current pandemic, suggesting that the vast majority of nonsynonymous mutations currently segregating within the human strains have a negative impact on viral fitness. Finally, we estimate that the time to the most recent common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 or RmYN02 based on synonymous divergence is 51.71 years (95% CI, 28.11-75.31) and 37.02 years (95% CI, 18.19-55.85), respectively.</Abstract>

        <Title>Possible host-adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 due to improved ACE2 receptor binding in mink Possible host-adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 due to improved ACE2 receptor binding in mink</Title>
        <Abstract>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections on mink farms are increasingly observed in several countries, leading to the massive culling of animals on affected farms. Recent studies showed multiple (anthropo)zoonotic transmission events between humans and mink on these farms. Mink-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences from The Netherlands and Denmark contain multiple substitutions in the S protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Molecular modeling showed that these substitutions increase the mean binding energy, suggestive of potential adaptation of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to the mink angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. These substitutions could possibly also impact human ACE2 binding affinity as well as humoral immune responses directed to the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in humans. We wish to highlight these observations to raise awareness and urge for the continued surveillance of mink (and other animal)-related infections.</Abstract>

        <Title>Indoor transmission dynamics of expired SARS-CoV-2 virus in a model African hospital ward Indoor transmission dynamics of expired SARS-CoV-2 virus in a model African hospital ward</Title>
        <Abstract>Cough and sneeze droplets' interactions with indoor air of a typical hospital clinic that could be majorly found in developing African countries were studied to investigate the effectiveness of existing guidelines/protocols being adopted in the control of the widespread coronavirus disease (COVID-19) transmission. The influences of indoor air velocity, the type, size distribution, residence time in air, and trajectory of the droplets, were all considered while interrogating the effectiveness of physical distancing measures, the use of face covers, cautionary activities of the general public, and the plausibility of community spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus through airborne transmission. Series of 3-D, coupled, discrete phase models (DPM) were implemented in the numerical studies. Based on DPM concentration maps as function of particle positions and particle residence times that were observed under different droplets release conditions, the virus-laden droplets could travel several meters away from the source of release (index patient), with smaller-sized particles staying longer in the air. The behavior of indoor air was also found to indicate complex dynamics as particle transports showed no linear dependence on air velocity.

        <Title>Implementing a real-time, AI-based, people detection and social distancing measuring system for Covid-19 Implementing a real-time, AI-based, people detection and social distancing measuring system for Covid-19</Title>
        <Abstract>COVID-19 is a disease caused by a severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It has resulted in an ongoing pandemic that caused infected cases including many deaths. Coronavirus is primarily spread between people during close contact. Motivating to this notion, this research proposes an artificial intelligence system for social distancing classification of persons using thermal images. By exploiting YOLOv2 (you look at once) approach, a novel deep learning detection technique is developed for detecting and tracking people in indoor and outdoor scenarios. An algorithm is also implemented for measuring and classifying the distance between persons and to automatically check if social distancing rules are respected or not. Hence, this work aims at minimizing the spread of the COVID-19 virus by evaluating if and how persons comply with social distancing rules. The proposed approach is applied to images acquired through thermal cameras, to establish a complete AI system for people tracking, social distancing classification, and body temperature monitoring. The training phase is done with two datasets captured from different thermal cameras. Ground Truth Labeler app is used for labeling the persons in the images. The proposed technique has been deployed in a low-cost embedded system (Jetson Nano) which is composed of a fixed camera. The proposed approach is implemented in a distributed surveillance video system to visualize people from several cameras in one centralized monitoring system. The achieved results show that the proposed method is suitable to set up a surveillance system in smart cities for people detection, social distancing classification, and body temperature analysis.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Introduction: An increasing number of children with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is being reported, yet the spectrum of disease severity and expression patterns of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in children at different developmental stages are largely unknow. Methods: We analysed clinical features in a cohort of 173 children with COVID-19 (0-15 yrs.-old) between January 22, 2020 and March 15, 2020. We systematically examined the expression and distribution of ACE2 in different developmental stages of children by using a combination of children's lung biopsies, pluripotent stem cell-derived lung cells, RNA-sequencing profiles, and ex vivo SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral infections. Results: It revealed that infants (&lt; 1yrs.-old), with a weaker potency of immune response, are more vulnerable to develop pneumonia whereas older children (&gt; 1 yrs.-old) are more resistant to lung injury. The expression levels of ACE2 however do not vary by age in children's lung. ACE2 is notably expressed not only in Alveolar Type II (AT II) cells, but also in SOX9 positive lung progenitor cells detected in both pluripotent stem cell derivatives and infants' lungs. The ACE2+SOX9+ cells are readily infected by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and the numbers of the double positive cells are significantly decreased in older children. Conclusions: Infants (&lt; 1 yrs.-old) with SARS-CoV-2 infection are more vulnerable to lung injuries. ACE2 expression in multiple types of lung cells including SOX9 positive progenitor cells, in cooperation with an unestablished immune system, could be risk factors contributing to vulnerability of infants with COVID-19. There is a need to continue monitoring lung development in young children who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection.</Abstract>

        <Title>Classical and alternative disinfection strategies to control the COVID-19 virus in healthcare facilities: a review Classical and alternative disinfection strategies to control the COVID-19 virus in healthcare facilities: a review</Title>
        <Abstract>The coronavirus disease COVID-19 has spread throughout the world and has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11th, 2020. The COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). One possible mode of virus transmission is through surfaces in the healthcare settings. This paper reviews currently used disinfection strategies to control SARS-CoV-2 at the healthcare facilities. Chemical disinfectants include hypochlorite, peroxymonosulfate, alcohols, quaternary ammonium compounds, and hydrogen peroxide. Advanced strategies include no-touch techniques such as engineered antimicrobial surfaces and automated room disinfection systems using hydrogen peroxide vapor or ultraviolet light.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>The psychological health of people all around the world is severely affected due to the COVID-19 outbreak. This study examined a moderated mediation model in which college belongingness mediated the relationship between coronavirus anxiety and psychological adjustment, and this mediation effect was moderated by social media addiction. A total of 315 undergraduate students (M = 21.65±3.68 years and 67% females) participated in this study. The results demonstrated that college belongingness partially mediated the association between coronavirus anxiety and psychological adjustment. The mediating part from coronavirus anxiety to college belongingness was moderated by social media addiction. In comparison with the high level of social media addiction, coronavirus anxiety had a stronger predictive effect on college belongingness under the low and moderate levels of social media addiction condition. Our findings highlight that college belongingness is a potential mechanism explaining how coronavirus anxiety is related to psychological adjustment and that this relation may depend on the levels of social media addiction.</Abstract>

        <Title>Coping with Stress During the Coronavirus Outbreak: the Contribution of Big Five Personality Traits and Social Support Coping with Stress During the Coronavirus Outbreak: the Contribution of Big Five Personality Traits and Social Support</Title>
        <Abstract>This study investigated the relationships between active, problem-focused, and maladaptive coping with stress during the Coronavirus outbreak, the Big Five personality traits, and social support among Israeli-Palestinian college students (n = 625). Emotion-focused coping negatively correlated with social support, openness, extraversion, conscientiousness, and agreeableness, while it positively correlated with neuroticism. On the other hand, problem-focused coping was found to positively correlate with social support, openness, extraversion, conscientiousness, and agreeableness, but negatively correlate with neuroticism. Thus, positive social support may increase one's ability to cope actively, adaptively, and efficiently. In addition, Israeli-Palestinian college students high in openness, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness tend to use active problem-focused coping while those high in neuroticism tend to use maladaptive emotion-focused coping.</Abstract>

        <Title>Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Cases on Medical Staff of Beijing Xiaotangshan Hospital Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Cases on Medical Staff of Beijing Xiaotangshan Hospital</Title>
        <Abstract>Purpose: To investigate the psychological impact of cases of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) on medical staff of Beijing Xiaotangshan Hospital. Methods: The 287 online questionnaires were distributed to medical staff working at Beijing Xiaotangshan Hospital, comprising three main sections and 17 questions: basic information, current departmental position, and the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). The threshold for emotional distress was defined to be a total score of 4 on the GHQ-12 and above. Results: A total of 255 members of medical staff participating in this study presented an emotional distress rate of 17%. Members who were male, aged 50-59, married with children, positioned as doctors, and in administration were the population with the highest rate of emotional distress. Furthermore, the severity of emotional distress among those under 30 was significantly lower than those aged 30-39 and 50-59. Doctors and other occupations shared a lower level of satisfaction on routine activities compared with nurses, so did staff in the administration compared with those who were working in screening or logistic departments. Besides, males and staff of the confirmation department had more difficulty in concentrating than females and those of the screening department, respectively. Conclusion: Medical staff working at Xiaotangshan Hospital underwent relatively low levels of emotional distress thanks to sufficient medical and psychological preparations. However, special attention should be paid to those who were male, married with children, senior, doctors, in administration, and in the confirmation department.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Objective: To investigate whether patients with epithelial ovarian cancer were affected by delayed chemotherapy during the coronavirus disease pandemic in 2020. Materials and methods: A delay of more than 21 days in the planned chemotherapy was defined as "delayed chemotherapy." Forty-five patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer were delayed between January 1 and March 30, 2020 in the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. Thirty-two cases were enrolled in this study. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was used in 8 cases; palliative chemotherapy was used in 5 cases; and maintenance chemotherapy was used in 19 cases. Data included age, pathological type, surgical pathological stage, chemotherapy time and CA125 levels were collected. The half-life of CA125 and the decrease in CA125 levels before and after delayed chemotherapy were calculated. Results: No patient got coronavirus disease. Compared with patients of ovarian cancer, fallopian tube epithelial cancer and peritoneal epithelial cancer in the same periods in 2019, the half-life of CA125 in neoadjuvant chemotherapy group and recurrence chemotherapy group were more than 20 days, but there was no significant difference. Only when the delayed chemotherapy took place before CA125 turned negative, accompanied by an interval of more than 60 days, the CA125 half-life and the decreased range of CA125 were totally affected. Conclusion: There was no evidence to support that once chemotherapy was delayed it would influence the decrease of CA125, but whether it would affect the long-term effects such as recurrence and five-year survival rate remains to be further followed up.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been affecting various sectors, including regular health services negatively. Vaccination, which saves the lives of 2-3 million populations of different age groups every year, is one of the most affected services by COVID-19. The routine vaccination services and outreach programs have been halted owing to lockdowns imposed on account of escalated cases of COVID-19 all over the world, affecting millions of lives at the stake of vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) henceforth. However, as it is becoming evident that we will have to live with COVID-19 for some time and many countries have lifted the lockdown, vaccination programs and campaigns have resumed with stringent preventive measures to be followed for COVID-19. These programs and campaigns have been trying to overlook and provide the missed vaccination during the imposed lockdown period and continue the other vaccination services to the public in the best possible ways. The collaborative approaches of various health-related organisations, governments and the healthcare workers are necessary to deliver the routine and mass vaccination services in an improvised manner.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Bacteria that colonize the human gastrointestinal tract are essential for good health. The gut microbiota has a critical role in pulmonary immunity and host's defense against viral respiratory infections. The gut microbiota's composition and function can be profoundly affected in many disease settings, including acute infections, and these changes can aggravate the severity of the disease. Here, we discuss mechanisms by which the gut microbiota arms the lung to control viral respiratory infections. We summarize the impact of viral respiratory infections on the gut microbiota and discuss the potential mechanisms leading to alterations of gut microbiota's composition and functions. We also discuss the effects of gut microbial imbalance on disease outcomes, including gastrointestinal disorders and secondary bacterial infections. Lastly, we discuss the potential role of the lung-gut axis in coronavirus disease 2019.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Shielding during the coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the potential of routinely collected primary care records to identify patients with 'high-risk' conditions, including severe asthma. We aimed to determine how previous studies have used primary care records to identify and investigate severe asthma and whether linkage to other data sources is required to fully investigate this 'high-risk' disease variant. A scoping review was conducted based on the Arksey and O'Malley framework. Twelve studies met all criteria for inclusion. We identified variation in how studies defined the background asthma cohort, asthma severity, control and clinical outcomes. Certain asthma outcomes could only be investigated through linkage to secondary care records. The ability of primary care records to represent the entire known asthma population is unique. However, a number of challenges need to be overcome if their full potential to accurately identify and investigate severe asthma is to be realised.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Background: As delayed intubation may worsen the outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), we sought to determine COVID-specific early predictors of CPAP failure. Methods: In this observational retrospective multicentre study, we included all COVID-19 patients treated with out-of-ICU CPAP, candidates for intubation in case of CPAP failure. From these patients, we collected demographic and clinical data. Results: A total of 397 COVID-19 patients were treated with CPAP for respiratory failure, with the therapeutic goal of providing intubation in case of CPAP failure. Univariable analysis showed that, age, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and white cell counts were all significantly lower in patients with successful CPAP treatment compared to those failing it and undergoing subsequent intubation. The percentage changes between baseline and CPAP application in the ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen (PaO2) and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), PaO2, respiratory rate and ROX index were higher in patients experiencing successful CPAP compared to those failing it. FiO2 and male gender were also significantly associated with intubation. Multivariable analysis adjusting for age, gender, Charlson comorbidity index, percentage change in PaO2/FiO2 or PaO2 and FiO2 separately, lactate, white blood cell count, LDH and C-reactive protein levels led to an area under the curve of 0.818 and confirmed that age, LDH and percentage increase in PaO2/FiO2 are predictors of intubation. Conclusions: In COVID-19 patients requiring CPAP, age, LDH and percentage change in PaO2/FiO2 after starting CPAP are predictors of intubation.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide over the last year causing more than one million deaths. Several treatments have tried to modify the natural history of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) but only corticosteroids have demonstrated to be effective in moderate or severe affectation. In that situation, the development of vaccines for preventing the SARS-CoV-2 infection has focused the attention of the scientific community. At present, available messenger RNA-based technology vaccines have received the approval of local and international sanitary authorities. In this position statement, the Spanish Society of Nephrology wants to state that patients with chronic kidney disease and healthcare workers are at high-risk for contagion and complications of COVID-19 so they must have priority in the vaccine administration.</Abstract>

        <Title>Cross-reactive Antibody Response between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Infections Cross-reactive Antibody Response between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Infections</Title>
        <Abstract>The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a pandemic. There is currently a lack of knowledge about the antibody response elicited from SARS-CoV-2 infection. One major immunological question concerns antigenic differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We address this question by analyzing plasma from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV and from infected or immunized mice. Our results show that, although cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses may be rare, indicating the presence of a non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike. Whether such low or non-neutralizing antibody response leads to antibody-dependent disease enhancement needs to be addressed in the future. Overall, this study not only addresses a fundamental question regarding antigenicity differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV but also has implications for immunogen design and vaccine development.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>In the current pandemic situation raised due to COVID-19, drug reuse is emerging as the first line of treatment. The viral agent that causes this highly contagious disease and the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) share high nucleotide similarity. Therefore, it is structurally expected that many existing viral targets are similar to the first SARS-CoV, probably being inhibited by the same compounds. Here, we selected two viral proteins based on their vital role in the viral life cycle: Structure of the main protease SARS-CoV-2 and the structural base of the SARS-CoV-2 protease 3CL, both supporting the entry of the virus into the human host. The approved drugs used were azithromycin, ritonavir, lopinavir, oseltamivir, ivermectin and heparin, which are emerging as promising agents in the fight against COVID-19. Our hypothesis behind molecular coupling studies is to determine the binding affinities of these drugs and to identify the main amino acid residues that play a fundamental role in their mechanism of action. Additional studies on a wide range of FDA-approved drugs, including a few more protein targets, molecular dynamics studies, in vitro and biological in vivo evaluation are needed to identify combination therapy targeted at various stages of the viral life cycle. In our experiment in silico, based mainly on the molecular coupling approach, we investigated six different types of pharmacologically active drugs, aiming at their potential application alone or in combination with the reuse of drugs. The ligands showed stable conformations when analyzing the affinity energy in both proteases: ivermectin forming a stable complex with the two proteases with values -8.727 kcal/mol for Main Protease and -9.784 kcal/mol for protease 3CL, Heparin with values of -7.647 kcal/mol for the Main protease and -7.737 kcal/mol for the 3CL protease. Both conform to the catalytic site of the proteases. Our studies can provide an insight into the possible interactions between ligands and receptors, through better conformation. The ligands ivermectin, heparin and ritonavir showed stable conformations. Our in-silica docking data shows that the drugs we have identified can bind to the binding compartment of both proteases, this strongly supports our hypothesis that the development of a single antiviral agent targeting Main protease, or 3CL protease, or an agent used in combination with other potential therapies, it could provide an effective line of defense against diseases associated with coronaviruses.</Abstract>

        <Title>Safe On-Boat Resuscitation by Lifeguards in COVID-19 Era: A Pilot Study Comparing Three Sets of Personal Protective Equipment Safe On-Boat Resuscitation by Lifeguards in COVID-19 Era: A Pilot Study Comparing Three Sets of Personal Protective Equipment</Title>
        <Abstract>Introduction: On-boat resuscitation can be applied by lifeguards in an inflatable rescue boat (IRB). Due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2) and recommendations for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), prehospital care procedures need to be re-evaluated. The objective of this study was to determine how the use of PPE influences the amount of preparation time needed before beginning actual resuscitation and the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR; QCPR) on an IRB. Methods: Three CPR tests were performed by 14 lifeguards, in teams of two, wearing different PPE: (1) Basic PPE (B-PPE): gloves, a mask, and protective glasses; (2) Full PPE (F-PPE): B-PPE + a waterproof apron; and (3) Basic PPE + plastic blanket (B+PPE). On-boat resuscitation using a bag-valve-mask (BVM) and high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter was performed sailing at 20km/hour. Results: Using B-PPE takes less time and is significantly faster than F-PPE (B-PPE 17 [SD = 2] seconds versus F-PPE 69 [SD = 17] seconds; P = .001), and the use of B+PPE is slightly higher (B-PPE 17 [SD = 2] seconds versus B+PPE 34 [SD = 6] seconds; P = .002). The QCPR remained similar in all three scenarios (P &gt;.05), reaching values over 79%. Conclusion: The use of PPE during on-board resuscitation is feasible and does not interfere with quality when performed by trained lifeguards. The use of a plastic blanket could be a quick and easy alternative to offer extra protection to lifeguards during CPR on an IRB.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Summary: This supplement to the series of regular Australian coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemiological reports describes the technical background to the surveillance data reported through Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA) as part of the nationally-coordinated response to COVID-19. Background: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in humans in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease subsequently spread rapidly, leading to a global pandemic.1 The predominant modes of transmission for COVID-19 are through direct or close contact with an infected person via respiratory droplets, or indirectly via contact with contaminated fomites.2 The median incubation period of COVID-19 is 5-6 days, ranging from 1 to 14 days.3,4 The infectious period remains uncertain; however, it is estimated to be from 48 hours before symptoms develop until two weeks after symptom onset.3,5 The predominant symptoms reported in COVID-19 cases are cough, sore throat, fatigue, runny nose and fever.6 The majority of cases recover from the disease without clinical intervention; however, approximately 20% of global cases result in more severe outcomes, such as shortness of breath and pneumonia, necessitating hospitalisation and the requirement of additional oxygen or ventilation.7,8 Severe or fatal outcomes are generally more common among elderly cases or those with comorbid conditions.8 A visual depiction of the severity spectrum of COVID-19, and of the data sources that we use in this report to measure aspects of severity, is provided in Figure 1.</Abstract>

        <Title>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and outcomes from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia: A Meta-Analysis and Meta-Regression Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and outcomes from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia: A Meta-Analysis and Meta-Regression</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: The number of positive and death cases from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still increasing until now. One of the most prone individuals, even in normal situations is patients with HIV. Currently, the evidence regarding the link between HIV and COVID-19 is still limited and conflicting. This study aims to analyze the relationship between HIV and poor outcomes of COVID-19 infection. Methods: We systematically searched the PubMed and Europe PMC database using specific keywords related to our aims until January 12th, 2021. All articles published on COVID-19 and HIV were retrieved. The quality of the study was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) tool for observational studies. Statistical analysis was done using Review Manager 5.4 and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3 software. Results: A total of 38 studies with 18,271,025 COVID-19 patients were included in this meta-analysis. This meta-analysis showed that HIV was not associated with composite poor outcome [OR 1.08 (95% CI 0.95 - 1.23), p = 0.26, I2 = 68%, random-effect modelling]. Meta-regression showed that the association with composite poor outcome was influenced by hypertension (p &lt; 0.00001) and diabetes (p = 0.0007). Subgroup analysis which involves only studies from African region showed that HIV was associated with composite poor outcomes [OR 1.11 (95% CI 1.03 - 1.21), p = 0.01, I2 = 0%, random-effect modelling]. Conclusions: Patients with HIV should still be considered as a population for whom precautions are needed to prevent the COVID-19. The availability of antiretroviral therapy should be ensured.</Abstract>

        <Title>COVID-19 Pandemic Impacts on U.S. Hospice Agencies: A National Survey of Hospice Nurses and Physicians COVID-19 Pandemic Impacts on U.S. Hospice Agencies: A National Survey of Hospice Nurses and Physicians</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: Hospice agencies face unique challenges during times of widespread public health emergencies. The pandemic of novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 is widely affecting global healthcare systems. Aim: This study assesses effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on U.S. hospice agencies, staff, and patients as reported by hospice agency staff. Design: An anonymous electronic survey was developed. Free-text comments were assessed for impacts on hospice agencies, staff, and patients and their families. Setting/participants: The target audience was members of the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine and the Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association who self-identified as being active with hospice agencies in the United States. Results: Reported impacts include inadequate supplies of personal protective equipment, changes in hospice services, and decreased access by hospice personnel to patients in long term care facilities. Flow of patients through hospice care settings was impeded. Agencies experienced changes in workforce availability and increased emotional support needs of staff. Patient and families experienced increased bereavement needs. Nearly one-third of respondents reported negative effects on patient outcomes, such as inadequate symptom management and negative psychosocial effects. Conclusion: Respondents indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic had negative effects on both hospice patient care and hospice agency functioning. Hospice agencies appear to face challenges unique among U.S. healthcare agencies due to their service delivery model and focus on interdisciplinary care. There is need for further exploration of the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic has on hospice agencies in order to improve care for their patient population during public health emergencies.</Abstract>

        <Title>Single-Line Flow Assay Platform Based on Orthogonal Emissive Upconversion Nanoparticles Single-Line Flow Assay Platform Based on Orthogonal Emissive Upconversion Nanoparticles</Title>
        <Abstract>Lateral flow assay (LFA) has played pivotal roles in many emergency public safety incidents, such as coronavirus disease diagnostics; however, the present double-line (test and control line) design strategy for LFA strips greatly restricts their applications in high-throughput quantitative analysis because the limited sample diffusion distance on the strips constrains the number of test/control lines. Herein, a novel single-line-based LFA (sLFA) strip, which combines test and control line, is developed by exploiting an orthogonal emissive upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) as a signal reporter on the test line, where one emission can be used as a reporting signal and the other as a calibrating signal. This UCNP-based test line with an interior reference also can play a validating role as a control line, and hence capturing antibodies are not needed for control lines, greatly saving fabrication costs. As a proof-of-concept, this novel sLFA strip is successfully explored to accurately and rapidly detect aflatoxin B1. Moreover, due to the removal of control lines, such a novel strategy greatly reduces the strip size, facilitating the design of a testing array for multiple detections of different samples. The test line herein is designed in a ring shape, and several test rings are assembled to be a chip for the testing of multiple samples. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of single-line-based LFA strips, which will significantly improve the detection capacities and accuracies and reduce the testing costs of LFA strips in real sample applications ranging from food analysis to in vitro diagnostics.</Abstract>

        <Title>A systematic review of clinical and laboratory parameters of 3,000 COVID-19 cases A systematic review of clinical and laboratory parameters of 3,000 COVID-19 cases</Title>
        <Abstract>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide. It is still a pandemic and poses major health problem across the globe. In our review, clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters of COVID-19 patients were compiled systematically, with special reference to pregnant women in order to understand the disease course. An extensive literature search on various scientific databases for relevant manuscripts was conducted, which yielded 7 manuscripts for final analysis. The most common symptoms were fever (85%), cough (70.63%), chest tightness (37.36%), expectoration (33.27%), fatigue (32%), dyspnea (31.95%), and shortness of breath (31.19%), while hemoptysis (1.0%) was the least common. The associated comorbidities were hypertension (21.6%) and diabetes (10.0%). In terms of hematological parameters, lower total leukocyte counts were observed in 65% of cases and biochemical parameters, patients demonstrated elevated levels of albumin (53.72%), lactate dehydrogenase (45.71%), and natriuretic peptide (34.84%); however, total bilirubin was elevated in only 8% of cases. In the acute inflammatory cytokine profile, C-reactive protein (59.0%), tumor necrosis factor (58.0%), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (57.0%), interleukin-2 (IL-2, 54.0%), and IL-6 (52.0%) levels were increased, while prolactin levels (6.5%) were minimally elevated. The recovery rate was approximately 41%, and mortality was about 6.5%. The study also concluded that the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 were similar among pregnant and non-pregnant women. There was no evidence of vertical transmission of COVID-19 infection. This review critically analyzed COVID-19 as a public health hazard in order to help policy makers, health care givers, and primary physicians to promote early diagnosis and prevention.</Abstract>

        <Title>The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Immunization Campaigns and Programs: A Systematic Review The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Immunization Campaigns and Programs: A Systematic Review</Title>
        <Abstract>The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on health service delivery, including immunization programs, and this review assesses the impact on vaccine coverage across the globe and identifies the potential underlying factors. A systematic search strategy was employed on PubMed, Embase, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, and WHO COVID-19 databases from December 2019 till 15 September 2020. Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed quality, and extracted the data (PROSPERO registration #CRD42020182363). A total of 17 observational studies were included. The findings suggest that there was a reduction in the vaccination coverage and decline in total number of vaccines administered, which led to children missing out on their vaccine doses. An approximately fourfold increase was also observed in polio cases in polio endemic countries. Factors contributing to low vaccine coverage included fear of being exposed to the virus at health care facilities, restriction on city-wide movements, shortage of workers, and diversion of resources from child health to address the pandemic. As the world re-strategizes for the post-2020 era, we should not let a crisis go to waste as they provide an opportunity to establish guidelines and allocate resources for future instances. High-quality supplementary immunization activities and catch-up programs need to be established to address gaps during the pandemic era.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>This study analyzed the levels of mental workload and the presence of burnout on a sample of fashion retailing workers from Spain and its relationship with the current CoViD-19 (Coronavirus disease-19) pandemic. We established a cross-sectional design. Participants (n = 360) answered an online survey including questions about sociodemographic data, perception of CoViD-19, CarMen-Q questionnaire (workload), and MBI (burnout syndrome). The survey campaign took place in October and November 2020. The results showed that participants exhibited deep concern about the CoViD-19 pandemic and its influence in the workplace. Although the mental workload was near the middle point of the scale, participants showed moderate to high burnout levels, revealing that the sample was at risk of experiencing higher burnout levels over time as the pandemic and associated economic crisis continued. The multiple regression analysis results indicated that environmental changes, work overload, somatic symptoms, insomnia, negative job expectations, and uncertainty constituted significant mental workload predictors. Insomnia, somatic symptoms, and negative job expectations constituted significant predictors for burnout. Differences between job positions and genders in mental workload and burnout were found. In conclusion, the uncertainty at work derived from the CoViD-19 pandemic harms fashion retailing workers' psychological well-being in Spain.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>The current wave and future trend of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has triggered public uncertainty, causing unbearable psychological pressure on people. A cross-sectional online questionnaire was conducted among back-to-school students in Wuhan from 31 August 2020, to 14 September 2020, by using convenience sampling. A total of 1017 participants voluntarily provided sociodemographic characteristics and accomplished the following scales: the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12), the Social Support Scale (SSQ), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Insomnia Severity Index-7 (ISI-7). Results revealed that the levels of anxiety, depression, and insomnia were moderate, moderate and subthreshold, respectively. A one-way multivariate analysis of variance indicated that those with different attitudes toward the trajectory of the COVID-19 epidemic in China showed significantly different results in anxiety and depression (p &lt; 0.001). Moderation modeling implicated that social support significantly moderated the predictive relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and mental health variables including anxiety and depression, but failed on insomnia. Findings indicate that back-to-school students in Wuhan experience mental health problems and improving social support measures could buffer the effect of intolerance of uncertainty with respect to COVID-19 on mental health.</Abstract>

        <Title>A Comprehensive Review of Detection Methods for SARS-CoV-2 A Comprehensive Review of Detection Methods for SARS-CoV-2</Title>
        <Abstract>Recently, the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in China and its subsequent spread across the world has caused numerous infections and deaths and disrupted normal social activity. Presently, various techniques are used for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with various advantages and weaknesses to each. In this paper, we summarize promising methods, such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), serological testing, point-of-care testing, smartphone surveillance of infectious diseases, nanotechnology-based approaches, biosensors, amplicon-based metagenomic sequencing, smartphone, and wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) that can also be utilized for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we discuss principles, advantages, and disadvantages of these detection methods, and highlight the potential methods for the development of additional techniques and products for early and fast detection of SARS-CoV-2.</Abstract>

        <Title>The Influence of Human-Animal Interactions on Mental and Physical Health during the First COVID-19 Lockdown Phase in the U.K.: A Qualitative Exploration The Influence of Human-Animal Interactions on Mental and Physical Health during the First COVID-19 Lockdown Phase in the U.K.: A Qualitative Exploration</Title>
        <Abstract>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents an opportunity to explore the role of animals as sources of emotional and physical support during a period when most of the population is experiencing social and environmental challenges. We investigated how companion animal owners perceived the influence of human-animal interaction on their physical and mental health during the first COVID-19 lockdown phase in the U.K., and what concerns they had regarding their animals at this time. We also explored the impact of participants' interaction with non-companion animals during this phase. A cross-sectional online survey of U.K. residents aged over 18 was conducted between April and June 2020. The final item of the survey invited open-ended free-text responses, allowing participants to describe any experiences and/or perceptions of their human-animal relationships during the COVID-19 lockdown phase. A qualitative thematic analysis of responses was undertaken. Four main themes related to the following aspects of human-animal interactions during the COVID-19 lockdown phase were identified: the positive impact of animal ownership during the COVID-19 lockdown (e.g., amelioration of wellbeing and mental health), concerns relating to animal ownership during the COVID-19 lockdown (e.g., concerns over animals carrying the COVID-19 virus), grief and loss of an animal during the COVID-19 lockdown and the impact of engaging with non-companion animals during the COVID-19 lockdown. The findings complement and extend previous insights into the impact of human-animal interaction with both companion and non-companion animals. They also highlight the challenges of caring for an animal during the lockdown phase and indicate the need to consider the development of further targeted support strategies, such as "day care" for the companion animals of key workers in this context.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic posed a serious public health concern and started a race against time for researchers to discover an effective and safe therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. This review aims to describe the history, efficacy, and safety of five potential therapeutics for COVID-19, remdesivir, favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, and convalescent plasma. A literature review was conducted through October 2020 to identify published studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of these five potential therapeutics. Clinical improvement was used to assess the efficacy, while reported withdrawals from study participation and adverse events were used to evaluate the safety. In total, 95 clinical studies (6 interventional and 89 observational studies) were obtained, of which 42 were included in this review. The evaluation of the efficacy and safety profiles is challenging due to the limitations of the clinical studies on one hand, and the limited number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the other. Moreover, there was insufficient evidence to support repurposing remdesivir, favipiravir, and tocilizumab for COVID-19.</Abstract>

        <Title>Interactions of Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 with the Lung Endothelium: Similarities, Differences, and Implications for Therapy Interactions of Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 with the Lung Endothelium: Similarities, Differences, and Implications for Therapy</Title>
        <Abstract>Respiratory viruses such as influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are a constant threat to public health given their ability to cause global pandemics. Infection with either virus may lead to aberrant host responses, such as excessive immune cell recruitment and activation, dysregulated inflammation, and coagulopathy. These may contribute to the development of lung edema and respiratory failure. An increasing amount of evidence suggests that lung endothelial cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of both viruses. In this review, we discuss how infection with influenza or SARS-CoV-2 may induce endothelial dysfunction. We compare the effects of infection of these two viruses, how they may contribute to pathogenesis, and discuss the implications for potential treatment. Understanding the differences between the effects of these two viruses on lung endothelial cells will provide important insight to guide the development of therapeutics.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on cancer diagnosis in general and specialized practices in Germany. This study included a total of 102,009 patients aged ≥18 years newly diagnosed with cancer in 1660 practices in Germany from January to May 2019 and from January to May 2020. Practices included general, gynecology, ear, nose, and throat (ENT), dermatology, and urology practices. New cancer diagnoses included all types of cancer and corresponded to cancers not previously documented in the database for a given patient. The number of new cancer diagnoses per general practice decreased significantly between March and May 2020 compared with the same period in 2019 (March: -12.0%, April: -27.6%, and May: -23.4%). A similar trend was observed in specialized practices, and this trend was more pronounced in April 2020 (dermatology: -44.4%, gynecology: -32.0%, and ENT: -28.2%). In addition, there was a significant decrease in almost all sex and age groups in April and May 2020 compared with the same period in 2019. Finally, the decrease in the number of new cancer diagnoses was particularly pronounced among cancers of the skin and the respiratory and intrathoracic organs. Together, these data show that the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant negative impact on cancer diagnosis in Germany, highlighting the need for public health measures improving the management of cancer in this country during this ongoing pandemic.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly worldwide. This study aimed to assess and predict the incidence of COVID-19 in Thailand, including the preparation and evaluation of intervention strategies. An SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered) model was implemented with model parameters estimated using the Bayesian approach. The model's projections showed that the highest daily reported incidence of COVID-19 would be approximately 140 cases (95% credible interval, CrI: 83-170 cases) by the end of March 2020. After Thailand declared an emergency decree, the numbers of new cases and case fatalities decreased, with no new imported cases. According to the model's predictions, the incidence would be zero at the end of June if non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were strictly and widely implemented. These stringent NPIs reduced the effective reproductive number (Rt) to 0.73 per day (95% CrI: 0.53-0.93) during April and May. Sensitivity analysis showed that contact rate, hand washing, and face mask wearing effectiveness were the parameters that most influenced the number of reported daily new cases. Our evaluation shows that Thailand's intervention strategies have been highly effective in mitigating disease propagation. Continuing with these strict disease prevention behaviors could minimize the risk of a new COVID-19 outbreak in Thailand.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all aspects of society. Researchers worldwide have been working to provide new solutions to and better understanding of this coronavirus. In this research, our goal was to perform a Bibliometric Network Analysis (BNA) to investigate the strategic themes, thematic evolution structure and trends of coronavirus during the first eight months of COVID-19 in the Web of Science (WoS) database in 2020. To do this, 14,802 articles were analyzed, with the support of the SciMAT software. This analysis highlights 24 themes, of which 11 of the more important ones were discussed in-depth. The thematic evolution structure shows how the themes are evolving over time, and the most developed and future trends of coronavirus with focus on COVID-19 were visually depicted. The results of the strategic diagram highlight 'CHLOROQUINE', 'ANXIETY', 'PREGNANCY' and 'ACUTE-RESPIRATORY-SYNDROME', among others, as the clusters with the highest number of associated citations. The thematic evolution. structure presented two thematic areas: "Damage prevention and containment of COVID-19" and "Comorbidities and diseases caused by COVID-19", which provides new perspectives and futures trends of the field. These results will form the basis for future research and guide decision-making in coronavirus focused on COVID-19 research and treatments.</Abstract>

        <Title>Strategies for Vaccination: Conventional Vaccine Approaches Versus New-Generation Strategies in Combination with Adjuvants Strategies for Vaccination: Conventional Vaccine Approaches Versus New-Generation Strategies in Combination with Adjuvants</Title>
        <Abstract>The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has raised significant economic, social, and psychological concerns. The rapid spread of the virus, coupled with the absence of vaccines and antiviral treatments for SARS-CoV-2, has galvanized a major global endeavor to develop effective vaccines. Within a matter of just a few months of the initial outbreak, research teams worldwide, adopting a range of different strategies, embarked on a quest to develop effective vaccine that could be effectively used to suppress this virulent pathogen. In this review, we describe conventional approaches to vaccine development, including strategies employing proteins, peptides, and attenuated or inactivated pathogens in combination with adjuvants (including genetic adjuvants). We also present details of the novel strategies that were adopted by different research groups to successfully transfer recombinantly expressed antigens while using viral vectors (adenoviral and retroviral) and non-viral delivery systems, and how recently developed methods have been applied in order to produce vaccines that are based on mRNA, self-amplifying RNA (saRNA), and trans-amplifying RNA (taRNA). Moreover, we discuss the methods that are being used to enhance mRNA stability and protein production, the advantages and disadvantages of different methods, and the challenges that are encountered during the development of effective vaccines.</Abstract>

        <Title>Analysis of Policies Based on the Multi-Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity, in Terms of the Number of Deaths in the Coronavirus Epidemic Analysis of Policies Based on the Multi-Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity, in Terms of the Number of Deaths in the Coronavirus Epidemic</Title>
        <Abstract>It has been a year since the outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic 2019 (COVID-19). In the face of the global epidemic, governments in all countries have taken different prevention measures, such as social isolation, mandatory health protection, and the closure of schools and workplaces. The situation of the epidemic has clearly varied from country to country. In this context, research on the impact of policies for the control of the spread of the global epidemic is of great significance. In this paper, we examined data from a sample of 212 countries between 31 December 2019, and 21 May 2020, using multi-fuzzy regression discontinuity. We found that developed countries had relatively low sensitivity to the policy stringency index; however, policy control measures had a significant effect on epidemic control. In addition, the trend analysis showed that the corresponding management and control came into play only after the policy stringency index reached 50 or the policy management reached level II, and the robustness was optimal at this time. Therefore, the governments in all countries should realize that epidemic prevention and control are of great importance. They can strengthen policy stringency to control the spread of the epidemic, considering their national conditions in terms of the economy and health system.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>North of Italy was severely hit by the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 19) pandemic. This induced the government to adopt severely restrictive measures to reduce the contagion risk, forcing most of the population to stop working and from leisure activities, and to remain at home for several weeks. Our study aimed to evaluate the effect of COVID-related quarantine on smoking and dietary habits of a well-characterized northern Italian rural population. For this purpose, while lockdown restrictions were in place (February-April 2020), 359 subjects from the Brisighella Heart Study cohort underwent a phone interview about their lifestyle habit changes during COVID-19-related quarantine. Quarantine did not significantly modify smoking habit nor body mass index. Subjects significantly increased daily carbohydrates consumption, all fresh vegetables, healthy vegetable oils, milk and yogurt, alcoholic drinks, sugars and sweets, and coffee. The weekly consumption of low-fat meat, cured meat other than ham, cheeses, eggs, nuts and mixed seed oils significantly increased, while the weekly intake of fish, mussels, and legumes significantly decreased during lockdown. The Dietary Quality Index was reduced from 42.4 ± 4.1 to 37.8 ± 4.7 (p &lt; 0.03). In accordance with our findings, COVID-19-related quarantine might worsen the quality of diet, also leading to an increased intake of almost all food categories.</Abstract>

        <Title>Multi-Organ Involvement in COVID-19: Beyond Pulmonary Manifestations Multi-Organ Involvement in COVID-19: Beyond Pulmonary Manifestations</Title>
        <Abstract>Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19), due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become an on-going global health emergency affecting over 94 million cases with more than 2 million deaths globally. Primarily identified as atypical pneumonia, it has developed into severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a multi-organ dysfunction with associated fatality. Ever since its emergence, COVID-19 with its plethora of clinical presentations has signalled its dynamic nature and versatility of the disease process. Being a disease with droplet transmission has now assumed the proportion of a suspected airborne nature which, once proved, poses a Herculean task to control. Because of the wide distribution of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (hACE2) receptors, known for its transmission, we envisage its multiorgan spread and extensive disease distribution. Thus, an extensive review of the extrapulmonary organotropism of SARS-CoV-2 with organ-specific pathophysiology and associated manifestations like dermatological complications, myocardial dysfunction, gastrointestinal symptoms, neurologic illnesses, hepatic and renal injury is needed urgently. The plausible mechanism of site-specific viral invasion is also discussed to give a comprehensive understanding of disease complexity, to help us to focus on research priorities and therapeutic strategies to counter the disease progression. A note on the latest advancements in vaccine research will enlighten the scientific world and equip it for better preparedness.</Abstract>

        <Title>3D Bioprinting of In Vitro Models Using Hydrogel-Based Bioinks 3D Bioprinting of In Vitro Models Using Hydrogel-Based Bioinks</Title>
        <Abstract>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has recently emerged as a global pandemic, has caused a serious economic crisis due to the social disconnection and physical distancing in human society. To rapidly respond to the emergence of new diseases, a reliable in vitro model needs to be established expeditiously for the identification of appropriate therapeutic agents. Such models can be of great help in validating the pathological behavior of pathogens and therapeutic agents. Recently, in vitro models representing human organs and tissues and biological functions have been developed based on high-precision 3D bioprinting. In this paper, we delineate an in-depth assessment of the recently developed 3D bioprinting technology and bioinks. In particular, we discuss the latest achievements and future aspects of the use of 3D bioprinting for in vitro modeling.</Abstract>

        <Title>Inequality-Related Health and Social Factors and Their Impact on Well-Being during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings from a National Survey in the UK Inequality-Related Health and Social Factors and Their Impact on Well-Being during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings from a National Survey in the UK</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: Lower socioeconomic groups and disadvantaged populations across the world suffer disproportionately from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study aimed to examine the impact of health- and social-inequality-related factors on well-being in order to further distinguish each of their effects during the pandemic. Methods: A nationally-representative sample of 5077 UK respondents aged 18 years or older was recruited through an online survey panel during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their subjective well-being was measured using the 11-point Cantril Ladder of Life Scale. The impact of inequality-related health and social factors (pre-existing medical conditions, household size and occupation), as well as COVID-19-related risk factors (symptoms, confirmed infections, and social distancing behaviours) on well-being were analysed using multiple linear regression models. The associations between the COVID-19-related risk factors and well-being according to the respondents' household size and occupation were modelled in order to test the differences by their socioeconomic profile. Results: We identified inverted V-shaped associations between household size and subjective well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to single-person households, respondents from households of two to four persons showed better well-being (β = 0.57; CI (0.44, 0.72)), whereas living in crowded households of five persons or more was associated with decreased well-being (β = -0.48; CI (-0.71, -0.25)). Furthermore, lower-skilled occupations (elementary occupations: β = -0.31; CI (-0.58, -0.03); logistics and transport services: β = -0.37; CI (-0.74, -0.01)) and chronic medical conditions (cardiometabolic or respiratory diseases: β = -0.25; CI (-0.41, -0.1); and mental health conditions: β = -1.12; CI (-1.28, -0.96)) were factors associated with reduced well-being during the pandemic. Interactions between a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, symptoms, and crowded households were identified (β = -0.95; CI (-1.76, -0.14) and β = -4.74; CI (-9.87, -1.61), respectively). Conclusions: In a national sample, the levels of general subjective well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns were disproportionately distributed across different groups within society. Preventive policies should explicitly focus on reaching lower socioeconomic groups; more emphasis should be placed on the coordination of multisectoral support in order to tackle existing health and social inequalities.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Dendritic cells (DC) connect the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system and carry out numerous roles that are significant in the context of viral disease. Their functions include the control of inflammatory responses, the promotion of tolerance, cross-presentation, immune cell recruitment and the production of antiviral cytokines. Based primarily on the available literature that characterizes the behaviour of many DC subsets during Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we speculated possible mechanisms through which DC could contribute to COVID-19 immune responses, such as dissemination of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to lymph nodes, mounting dysfunctional inteferon responses and T cell immunity in patients. We highlighted gaps of knowledge in our understanding of DC in COVID-19 pathogenesis and discussed current pre-clinical development of therapies for COVID-19.</Abstract>

        <Title>Assessing the Impact of COVID-19 on Antimicrobial Stewardship Activities/Programs in the United Kingdom Assessing the Impact of COVID-19 on Antimicrobial Stewardship Activities/Programs in the United Kingdom</Title>
        <Abstract>Since first identified in late 2019, the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) and the resulting coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems worldwide, often diverting key resources in a bid to meet unprecedented challenges. To measure its impact on national antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) activities, a questionnaire was designed and disseminated to antimicrobialstewardship leads in the United Kingdom (UK). Most respondents reported a reduction in AMS activity with 64% (61/95) reporting that COVID-19 had a negative impact on routine AMS activities. Activities reported to have been negatively affected by the pandemic include audit, quality improvement initiatives, education, AMS meetings, and multidisciplinary working including ward rounds. However, positive outcomes were also identified, with technology being increasingly used as a tool to facilitate stewardship e.g., virtual meetings and ward rounds and increased the acceptance of using procalcitonin tests to distinguish between viral and bacterial infections. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the AMS activities undertaken across the UK. The long-term impact of the reduced AMS activities on incidence of AMR are not yet known. The legacy of innovation, use of technology, and increased collaboration from the pandemic could strengthen AMS in the post-pandemic era and presents opportunities for further development of AMS.</Abstract>

        <Title>SARS-CoV-2: Outline, Prevention, and Decontamination SARS-CoV-2: Outline, Prevention, and Decontamination</Title>
        <Abstract>The new coronavirus began to spread around the world in late 2019. Initially, it was found only in China, but in the following days there were reported cases of infections in other countries. Subsequently, based on taxonomy, phylogeny, and accepted practice, the virus was officially designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As a result of the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in different countries around the world, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a status change in the disease caused by this coronavirus-from an epidemic to a pandemic disease. Although the world is taking unprecedented efforts to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the number of confirmed cases is rising. Therefore, effective preventive measures are needed in order to limit the spread of illness. The prevention measures are mainly based on information on the virus transmission routes, its environmental stability, and persistence on commonly touched surfaces. Social distancing, mask usage, and good hygiene practice are the most important recommendations for general public. Healthcare professionals who are directly involved in SARS-CoV-2 patients care are more exposed to virus infection and additional protection measures are necessary, including protective suits, aprons, face shields, goggles, and gloves. Due to the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on different surfaces, such as glass, paper, or wood, proper disinfection is crucial. Several studies have shown that despite the virus's stability, it is sensitive to various disinfectants, such as ethanol, isopropanol, sodium hypochlorite, or hydrogen peroxide. These findings underline the importance of having comprehensive knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 and multidirectional strategies in order to limit the spread of the virus. This review is a summary of the most important information about SARS-CoV-2, such as its stability on different surfaces, protection strategies, and decontamination options.</Abstract>

        <Title>Mechanistic Implications of Biomass-Derived Particulate Matter for Immunity and Immune Disorders Mechanistic Implications of Biomass-Derived Particulate Matter for Immunity and Immune Disorders</Title>
        <Abstract>Particulate matter (PM) is a major and the most harmful component of urban air pollution, which may adversely affect human health. PM exposure has been associated with several human diseases, notably respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. In particular, recent evidence suggests that exposure to biomass-derived PM associates with airway inflammation and can aggravate asthma and other allergic diseases. Defective or excess responsiveness in the immune system regulates distinct pathologies, such as infections, hypersensitivity, and malignancies. Therefore, PM-induced modulation of the immune system is crucial for understanding how it causes these diseases and highlighting key molecular mechanisms that can mitigate the underlying pathologies. Emerging evidence has revealed that immune responses to biomass-derived PM exposure are closely associated with the risk of diverse hypersensitivity disorders, including asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and allergen sensitization. Moreover, immunological alteration by PM accounts for increased susceptibility to infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Evidence-based understanding of the immunological effects of PM and the molecular machinery would provide novel insights into clinical interventions or prevention against acute and chronic environmental disorders induced by biomass-derived PM.</Abstract>

        <Title>Anxiety in Frontline and Non-Frontline Healthcare Providers in Kelantan, Malaysia Anxiety in Frontline and Non-Frontline Healthcare Providers in Kelantan, Malaysia</Title>
        <Abstract>In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, healthcare providers are exposed to psychological and mental health implications, including vicarious traumatization, anxiety, and depression. Gradual increases in the number of COVID-19 cases meant they were inadequately protected from contamination due to a shortage of protective equipment, excessive workloads, emotional exhaustion and frustration. These circumstances affect their work performance in delivering health services. This study aims to compare the levels of anxiety in frontline and non-frontline healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study applied a comparative cross-sectional design between May and July 2020 at the Hospital Raja Perempuan Zainab II. Convenient sampling was applied in the selection of eligible participants. The case report form contained two self-administered questionnaires, namely, The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Medical Outcome Study Social Support Survey. Descriptive analysis, analysis of variance, and analysis of covariance were conducted using SPSS version 26. The number of participants recruited was 306, including 160 healthcare providers in the frontline group and 146 in the non-frontline group. The non-frontline healthcare providers reported a significantly higher anxiety mean score of 1.7 than the frontline providers after adjusting for gender, duration of employment, and social support. It indicates that non-frontline healthcare providers require psychological support similar to that of frontline healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>The COVID-19 pandemic is posing a major health crisis. Spanish legislation establishes the mandatory use of masks and the implementation of hygienic measures such as hand washing and physical distancing. The aim of this study is to describe access to information and the level of community knowledge/adoption about the preventive measures proposed by the Spanish health authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to analyze the influence of socio-demographic factors in compliance among people over 18 years of age resident in Spain. An observational, descriptive and transversal study was conducted. Data was collected on sociodemographic variables, access to information and the degree of knowledge/adoption about the preventive measures: use of masks, hand hygiene and physical distancing. A total of 1811 people participated. The average age was 45.1 ± 15.1 years, predominantly female (69.3%), from an urban geographical area (74%), with a higher education level of 53.2%. Most of the respondents (57.5%) are or live with people at risk. The main access to information on preventive measures was from secondary sources (49.2%), with television being the main medium; 72.3% think that there are some difficulties in accessing information, while 8.7% of the participants do not consider the use of masks to be useful. As regards the choice of type of mask, the majority of people (44.8%) opt for the surgical variety; 88.5% of respondents believe that the physical distancing established is at least 1.5 m. This study confirmed that socio-demographic factors influence compliance with or the degree of knowledge/adoption of the preventive measures proposed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and has made it possible to ascertain the sectors of the population with the greatest deficiencies in this respect. It shows the importance of implementing health information and education systems in the community, and it is advisable to promote specific programs aimed at men, people living in rural areas and people with a low level of education.</Abstract>

        <Title>Can SARS-CoV-2 Virus Use Multiple Receptors to Enter Host Cells? Can SARS-CoV-2 Virus Use Multiple Receptors to Enter Host Cells?</Title>
        <Abstract>The occurrence of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVD-19), represents a catastrophic threat to global health. Protruding from the viral surface is a densely glycosylated spike (S) protein, which engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to mediate host cell entry. However, studies have reported viral susceptibility in intra- and extrapulmonary immune and non-immune cells lacking ACE2, suggesting that the S protein may exploit additional receptors for infection. Studies have demonstrated interactions between S protein and innate immune system, including C-lectin type receptors (CLR), toll-like receptors (TLR) and neuropilin-1 (NRP1), and the non-immune receptor glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78). Recognition of carbohydrate moieties clustered on the surface of the S protein may drive receptor-dependent internalization, accentuate severe immunopathological inflammation, and allow for systemic spread of infection, independent of ACE2. Furthermore, targeting TLRs, CLRs, and other receptors (Ezrin and dipeptidyl peptidase-4) that do not directly engage SARS-CoV-2 S protein, but may contribute to augmented anti-viral immunity and viral clearance, may represent therapeutic targets against COVID-19.</Abstract>

        <Title>Case Report: Massive Spontaneous Pneumothorax-A Rare Form of Presentation for Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia Case Report: Massive Spontaneous Pneumothorax-A Rare Form of Presentation for Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia</Title>
        <Abstract>Background and Objectives: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a viral disease that is spreading worldwide and became a pandemic. Although most of the time, the symptoms of the infection are flu like, a percentage of patients develop severe forms, along with severe complications. Many of them are known among front-line health workers, but the number of uncommon presentations and complications has increased. This case report aims to alert healthcare workers on less common forms of presentation, and to introduce this differential diagnosis in the evaluation of patients with COVID-19, given the increasing occurrence of pneumothorax in patients who are not mechanical ventilated. Case presentation: A 57-year-old female patient came to the Emergency Department (ED) by ambulance, with acute respiratory failure. She had SpO2 = 43% on room air at home, and 86% on admission in ED after oxygen delivery (on a reservoir mask). SARS-CoV-2 infection was suspected based on symptoms that started three days ago (fever, dry cough, dyspnea, and fatigability). Blood was taken for lab tests, pharyngeal and nasal swabs for the reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) test, and native computed tomography (CT) was scheduled. The thoracic CT scan showed massive right pneumothorax, partially collapsed lung, multiple bilateral lung infiltrates with a ground glass aspect and the RT-PCR test came back positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite the prompt diagnosis and treatment of pneumothorax (thoracostomy was performed and the drain tube was placed), the patient died after a long hospitalization in the intensive care unit. Conclusion: Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP), as a complication in severe forms of COVID-19 pneumonia, especially in female patients without risk factors is rare, and early diagnosis and treatment are essential for increasing the survival chances of these patients.</Abstract>

        <Title>A 10-Minute "Mix and Read" Antibody Assay for SARS-CoV-2 A 10-Minute "Mix and Read" Antibody Assay for SARS-CoV-2</Title>
        <Abstract>Accurate and rapid diagnostic tools are needed for management of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Antibody tests enable detection of individuals past the initial phase of infection and help examine vaccine responses. The major targets of human antibody response in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are the spike glycoprotein (SP) and nucleocapsid protein (NP). We have developed a rapid homogenous approach for antibody detection termed LFRET (protein L-based time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer immunoassay). In LFRET, fluorophore-labeled protein L and antigen are brought to close proximity by antigen-specific patient immunoglobulins of any isotype, resulting in TR-FRET signal. We set up LFRET assays for antibodies against SP and NP and evaluated their diagnostic performance using a panel of 77 serum/plasma samples from 44 individuals with COVID-19 and 52 negative controls. Moreover, using a previously described SP and a novel NP construct, we set up enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 SP and NP. We then compared the LFRET assays with these ELISAs and with a SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization test (MNT). We found the LFRET assays to parallel ELISAs in sensitivity (90-95% vs. 90-100%) and specificity (100% vs. 94-100%). In identifying individuals with or without a detectable neutralizing antibody response, LFRET outperformed ELISA in specificity (91-96% vs. 82-87%), while demonstrating an equal sensitivity (98%). In conclusion, this study demonstrates the applicability of LFRET, a 10-min "mix and read" assay, to detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.</Abstract>

        <Title>Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) of occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater treatment plants Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) of occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater treatment plants</Title>
        <Abstract>The current global Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome- Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic has heightened calls for studies to evaluate respiratory exposure for wastewater treatment workers. In this global first study, we assess occupational health risks to wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) operators from inhalation of aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 using a Quantitative Microbiological Risk Assessment (QMRA) framework. The following considerations were used to develop the QMRA and assess the illness risks to workers: a) the proportion of the population who are infected and thus responsible for shedding SARS-CoV-2 into raw wastewater; b) the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in raw and treated wastewater; c) the volume of aerosolized water inhaled by a WWTP operator during work; d) humidity and temperature-dependent viability of coronaviruses in aerosolized waste water; e) estimation of the amount, frequency, and duration of exposure; and f) exposure doses. The variables were then fed into an exponential dose response model to estimate the risks in three scenarios representing low-grade, moderate and aggressive outbreaks. These scenarios were designed on the assumption of 0.03%, 0.3% and 3% of the wastewater-generating population being infected with SARS-CoV-2. In terms of averaged-out illness risk profiles, the individual illness risks for low grade, moderate and aggressive outbreak scenarios respectively are 0.036, 0.32 and 3.21 illness cases per 1000 exposed WWTP operators. Our study suggests that the risk of accidental occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewater, via inhalation at the WWTP environment, is negligible, particularly when less than 0.3% of the population served by the plant are actively infected.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Aims: Patients with advanced heart failure (HF) with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF) and concurrent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) might have a higher risk of severe events. Methods and results: We retrospectively studied 16 patients with advanced HFrEF who developed COVID-19 between 1 March and 29 May 2020. Follow-up lasted until 30 September. Ten patients previously hospitalized with decompensated HFrEF were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during hospitalization. Six patients undergoing ambulatory care at initiation of COVID-19 symptoms were hospitalized because of advanced HFrEF. All patients who experienced worsening of HFrEF due to COVID-19 required higher doses or introduction of additional inotropic drugs or intra-aortic balloon pump in the intensive care unit. The mean intravenous dobutamine dose before SARS-CoV-2 infection in previously hospitalized patients (n = 10) and the median (inter-quartile range) peak intravenous dobutamine dose during SARS-CoV-2 infection in all patients (n = 16) were 2 (0-7) μg/kg/min and 20 (14-20) (P &lt; 0.001), respectively. During follow-up, 56% underwent heart transplantation (n = 2) or died (n = 7). Four patients died during hospitalization from mixed shock consequent to severe acute respiratory syndrome with inflammatory storm syndrome associated with septic and cardiogenic shock during COVID-19. After COVID-19 recovery, two patients died from mixed septic and cardiogenic shock and one from sustained ventricular tachycardia and cardiogenic shock. Five patients were discharged from hospital to ambulatory care. Four were awaiting heart transplantation. Conclusion: Worsening of advanced HF by COVID-19 is associated with high mortality. This report highlights the importance of preventing COVID-19 in patients with advanced HF.</Abstract>

        <Title>Dynamic Changes of Lymphocyte Subsets in the Course of COVID-19 Dynamic Changes of Lymphocyte Subsets in the Course of COVID-19</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: Although the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not clearly defined, among the proposed mechanisms, immune system dysfunction is more likely than others. The aim of this study was to clarify the characteristics and clinical significance of dynamic changes of lymphocyte subsets in the course of COVID-19. Methods: In this prospective study, the levels of peripheral lymphocyte subsets including CD4+, CD8+, CD4+CD25+FOXP3+, CD38+, CD3+HLA-DR+, CD19+, CD20+, and CD16+CD56+ cells were measured by flow cytometry in 52 confirmed hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at the day of admission and after 7 days of care. Clinical response was defined as improvement in symptoms (fever, dyspnea, and cough as well as blood oxygen saturation), and patients who met these criteria after 1 week of admission were classified as early responders; others who survived and finally discharged from the hospital were classified as late responders and patients who died were categorized as nonresponders. Immunophenotyping of studied cell changes on the first day of admission and 7 days after treatment were compared. Besides, the correlation between cellular subset variation and clinical response and outcome were analyzed. Results: Total counts of white blood cell, T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD38+ lymphocytes, and CD3+HLA-DR+ lymphocytes were significantly increased in both early and late responders. No statistically significant difference was observed in CD4+/CD8+ ratio, B cells, FOXP3+Treg lymphocytes, and FOXP3 median fluorescence intensity among studied groups. According to the multivariate analysis, an increase in CD4+ T cells (p = 0.019), CD8+ T cells (p = 0.001), and administration of interferon (p &lt; 0.001) were independent predictors of clinical response. Conclusion: We found an increasing trend in total T cells, T helpers, cytotoxic T cells, activated lymphocytes, and natural killer cells among responders. This trend was not statistically significant among nonresponders. The findings of this study may enhance our knowledge about the pathogenesis of COVID-19.</Abstract>

A population-based electronic health record study Obesity during the COVID-19 pandemic: both cause of high risk and potential effect of lockdown? A population-based electronic health record study</Title>
        <Abstract>Objectives: Obesity is a modifiable risk factor for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related mortality. We estimated excess mortality in obesity, both 'direct', through infection, and 'indirect', through changes in health care, and also due to potential increasing obesity during lockdown. Study design: The study design of this study is a retrospective cohort study and causal inference methods. Methods: In population-based electronic health records for 1,958,638 individuals in England, we estimated 1-year mortality risk ('direct' and 'indirect' effects) for obese individuals, incorporating (i) pre-COVID-19 risk by age, sex and comorbidities, (ii) population infection rate and (iii) relative impact on mortality (relative risk [RR]: 1.2, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0). Using causal inference models, we estimated impact of change in body mass index (BMI) and physical activity during 3-month lockdown on 1-year incidence for high-risk conditions (cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic kidney disease), accounting for confounders. Results: For severely obese individuals (3.5% at baseline), at 10% population infection rate, we estimated direct impact of 240 and 479 excess deaths in England at RR 1.5 and 2.0, respectively, and indirect effect of 383-767 excess deaths, assuming 40% and 80% will be affected at RR = 1.2. Owing to BMI change during the lockdown, we estimated that 97,755 (5.4%: normal weight to overweight, 5.0%: overweight to obese and 1.3%: obese to severely obese) to 434,104 individuals (15%: normal weight to overweight, 15%: overweight to obese and 6%: obese to severely obese) would be at higher risk for COVID-19 over one year. Conclusions: Prevention of obesity and promotion of physical activity are at least as important as physical isolation of severely obese individuals during the pandemic.</Abstract>

        <Title>Increased placental expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, associated with hypoxia in twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS) Increased placental expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, associated with hypoxia in twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS)</Title>
        <Abstract>Introduction: Recent reports suggest SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, may be transmittable from pregnant mother to placenta and fetus, albeit rarely. The efficacy of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 critically depends on the availability of its receptor, ACE2, in the placenta. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that placental ACE2 expression is oxygenation-dependent by studying the expression of ACE2 and associated cell entry regulators in the monochorionic twin anemia-polycythemia (TAPS) placenta, a model of discordant placental oxygenation. Methods: We performed a retrospective comparative immunohistochemical, immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Cathepsin B expression in anemic and polycythemic territories of TAPS placentas (N = 14). Results: ACE2 protein levels were significantly higher in the anemic twin territories than in the corresponding polycythemic territories, associated with upregulation of the key ACE2-related cell entry regulators, TMPRSS2 and Cathepsin B, immunolocalized to villous trophoblastic and stromal cells. Cellular colocalization of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, suggestive of functionality of this cell entry axis, was demonstrated by double immunofluorescence studies. Discussion: Placental hypoxia is associated with upregulation of ACE2 expression, concomitant with increased expression of its key cell entry proteases. ACE2-regulated placental functions, both infection- and non-infection related, may be highly oxygenation-dependent.</Abstract>

        <Title>The COVID-19 pandemic face mask waste: A blooming threat to the marine environment The COVID-19 pandemic face mask waste: A blooming threat to the marine environment</Title>
        <Abstract>Recently, the COVID-19 disease spread has emerged as a worldwide pandemic and cause severe threats to humanity. The World Health Organisation (WHO) releases guidelines to help the countries to reduce the spread of this virus to the public, like wearing masks, hand hygiene, social distancing, shutting down all types of public transports, etc. These conditions led to a worldwide economic fall drastically, and on the other hand, indirect environmental benefits like global air quality improvement and decreased water pollution are also pictured. Currently, use of face masks is part of a comprehensive package of the prevention and control measures that can limit the spread of COVID-19 since there is no clinically proven drugs or vaccine available for COVID-19. Mostly, face masks are made of petroleum-based non-renewable polymers that are non-biodegradable, hazardous to the environment and create health issues. This study demonstrates the extensive use of the face mask and how it affects human health and the marine ecosystem. It has become a great challenge for the government sectors to impose strict regulations for the proper disposal of the masks as medical waste by the public. Neglecting the seriousness of this issue may lead to the release of large tonnes of micro-plastics to the landfill as well as to the marine environment where mostly end-up and thereby affecting their fauna and flora population vastly. Besides, this study highlights the COVID-19 spread, its evolutionary importance, taxonomy, genomic structure, transmission to humans, prevention, and treatment.</Abstract>

        <Title>Multi-classifier-based identification of COVID-19 from chest computed tomography using generalizable and interpretable radiomics features Multi-classifier-based identification of COVID-19 from chest computed tomography using generalizable and interpretable radiomics features</Title>
        <Abstract>Purpose: To investigate the efficacy of radiomics in diagnosing patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and other types of viral pneumonia with clinical symptoms and CT signs similar to those of COVID-19. Methods: Between 18 January 2020 and 20 May 2020, 110 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 108 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients were retrospectively recruited from three hospitals based on the inclusion criteria. Manual segmentation of pneumonia lesions on CT scans was performed by four radiologists. The latest version of Pyradiomics was used for feature extraction. Four classifiers (linear classifier, k-nearest neighbour, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator [LASSO], and random forest) were used to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 positive and SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. Comparison of the performance of the classifiers and radiologists was evaluated by ROC curve and Kappa score. Results: We manually segmented 16,053 CT slices, comprising 32,625 pneumonia lesions, from the CT scans of all patients. Using Pyradiomics, 120 radiomic features were extracted from each image. The key radiomic features screened by different classifiers varied and lead to significant differences in classification accuracy. The LASSO achieved the best performance (sensitivity: 72.2%, specificity: 75.1%, and AUC: 0.81) on the external validation dataset and attained excellent agreement (Kappa score: 0.89) with radiologists (average sensitivity: 75.6%, specificity: 78.2%, and AUC: 0.81). All classifiers indicated that "Original_Firstorder_RootMeanSquared" and "Original_Firstorder_Uniformity" were significant features for this task. Conclusions: We identified radiomic features that were significantly associated with the classification of COVID-19 pneumonia using multiple classifiers. The quantifiable interpretation of the differences in features between the two groups extends our understanding of CT imaging characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia.</Abstract>

        <Title>CRISPR-based detection of SARS-CoV-2: A review from sample to result CRISPR-based detection of SARS-CoV-2: A review from sample to result</Title>
        <Abstract>The current pandemic of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) has raised significant public health concern. Rapid, affordable, and accurate diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for early treatment and control of the disease spread. In the past few years, CRISPR technology has shown great potential for highly sensitive and specific molecular diagnostics. Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there is an increasing interest in implementing CRISPR-based diagnostic principles to develop fast and precise methods for detecting SARS-CoV-2. In this work, we reviewed and summarized these CRISPR-based diagnostic systems as well as their characteristics and challenges. We also provided future perspectives of CRISPR-based sensing towards point-of-care molecular diagnosis applications.</Abstract>

        <Title>Optical technologies for the detection of viruses like COVID-19: Progress and prospects Optical technologies for the detection of viruses like COVID-19: Progress and prospects</Title>
        <Abstract>The outbreak of life-threatening pandemic like COVID-19 necessitated the development of novel, rapid and cost-effective techniques that facilitate detection of viruses like SARS-CoV-2. The presently popular approach of a collection of samples using the nasopharyngeal swab method and subsequent detection of RNA using the real-time polymerase chain reaction suffers from false-positive results and a longer diagnostic time scale. Alternatively, various optical techniques namely optical sensing, spectroscopy, and imaging shows a great promise in virus detection. Herein, a comprehensive review of the various photonics technologies employed for virus detection, particularly the SARS-CoV family, is discussed. The state-of-art research activities in utilizing the photonics tools such as near-infrared spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence-based techniques, super-resolution microscopy, surface plasmon resonance-based detection, for virus detection accounted extensively with an emphasis on coronavirus detection. Further, an account of emerging photonics technologies of SARS-CoV-2 detection and future possibilities is also explained. The progress in the field of optical techniques for virus detection unambiguously show a great promise in the development of rapid photonics-based devices for COVID-19 detection.</Abstract>

        <Title>Severe COVID-19 pneumonia in Piacenza, Italy - A cohort study of the first pandemic wave Severe COVID-19 pneumonia in Piacenza, Italy - A cohort study of the first pandemic wave</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: Piacenza is the closest city to the first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cluster in Italy and has the highest national COVID-19 death rates per population. The objective of this study is to present characteristics and outcomes of patients admitted to medical departments of the Hospital of Piacenza during the first wave of the epidemic. Methods: A total of 218 patients with confirmed or suspect COVID-19 and severe pneumonia were included from February 21st to May 15th, 2020. Routinely-collected clinical and laboratory data were retrospectively retrieved from electronic medical files. A Cox proportional-hazards model was fit to assess the association of treatment and other variables with death. Results: Median age of patients was 68 years; 150 patients (69%) had comorbidities, mainly hypertension (107, 49%). Overall, 185 (85%) patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) on admission, including 103 (47%) with moderate or severe ARDS. Chest computed tomography scan showed bilateral disease in 201 (98%) and extensive lung involvement in 79 (50%) patients. Most patients received antiviral treatment (187, 86%) and corticosteroids (134, 61%). All patients received respiratory support and 64 (29%) were admitted to intensive care unit. As of June 30th, 100 patients (46%) died, 109 patients (50%) were discharged, and 9 patients (4%) were still hospitalized. In multivariable Cox analysis, age above 65 years, having more than one comorbidity, severe ARDS, low platelet counts, and high LDH levels at admission were associated with mortality, while having diarrhea at admission was associated with survival. The use of antivirals or corticosteroids was not associated with survival. Conclusions: Overall case fatality rates were high and associated with comorbidities, extensive lung involvement, ARDS at admission, and advanced age. The use of antivirals was not associated with increased survival.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>In recent years, a total of seven human pathogenic coronaviruses (HCoVs) strains were identified, i.e., SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1. Here, we performed an analysis of the protease recognition sites and antigenic variation of the S-protein of these HCoVs. We showed tissue-specific expression pattern, functions, and a number of recognition sites of proteases in S-proteins from seven strains of HCoVs. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, we found two new protease recognition sites, each of calpain-2, pepsin-A, and caspase-8, and one new protease recognition site each of caspase-6, caspase-3, and furin. Our antigenic mapping study of the S-protein of these HCoVs showed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus strain has the most potent antigenic epitopes (highest antigenicity score with maximum numbers of epitope regions). Additionally, the other six strains of HCoVs show common antigenic epitopes (both B-cell and T-cell), with low antigenicity scores compared to SARS-CoV-2. We suggest that the molecular evolution of structural proteins of human CoV can be classified, such as (i) HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, (ii) SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV and (iii) HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. In conclusion, we can presume that our study might help to prepare the interventions for the possible HCoVs outbreaks in the future.</Abstract>

        <Title>Antiviral activity of bioactive phytocompounds against coronavirus: An update Antiviral activity of bioactive phytocompounds against coronavirus: An update</Title>
        <Abstract>Viral infections are one of the main cause of diseases worldwide due to the rising trends of migration, urbanization and global mobility of humans. The outbreak of corona virus diseases caused by SARS-CoV (year 2003), MERS-CoV (year 2012) and SARS-CoV-2 (year 2019) raised global health concerns. The side effects associated with the conventional drugs and increase in cases of anti-microbial resistance have led the researchers to switch to natural sources, especially plants, as they have immense potential to be used as antiviral agents. The aim of the article is to summarize the evidences of the bioactive phytocompounds from different plants as an effective alternative for the treatment of infections caused by coronaviruses. However, the use of most plant compounds succumbs to limitations due to lack of experimental evidences and safety studies. Therefore, further research and studies are required to validate their therapeutic uses for wide application of plant-based medicine, including anti-virals.</Abstract>

        <Title>Management of Chronic Pain in Nursing Homes: Navigating Challenges to Improve Person-Centered Care Management of Chronic Pain in Nursing Homes: Navigating Challenges to Improve Person-Centered Care</Title>
        <Abstract>Despite the dynamic demands in the nursing home (NH), a definitive approach to managing chronic pain in older adults has yet to be established. Due to concerns for potential adverse pharmacologic effects, balancing appropriate pain management is a challenge among NH residents. The challenges encompass but are not limited to medical complexities, functional disabilities, and physical frailty. Barriers to the successful implementation of a comprehensive chronic pain management at the NH may include ambiguous directions on specific therapeutic interventions, insufficient guidance on treatment duration, and limited available treatment options. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' reporting requirement of adequate pain control among NH residents coupled with widely variable clinician-prescribing habits highlights the difficulties in overcoming the preceding challenges and barriers. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has further complicated pain management due to its negative consequences on well-being of residents of NHs. Associated symptoms of psychosocial stress, anxiety and depression, and chronic pain symptoms can exacerbate during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to increased requirement for pain medications including but not limited to opioids. Pain is a multidimensional symptom and requires a strategic multimodal approach for its management. Nonpharmacologic modalities are underutilized in the NH setting and are the preferred first steps for mild pain, and nonopioid pharmacological agents can be added as a second step for a synergistic effect for moderate to severe pain. Opioids should be used as a last resort. Short-acting opioids are preferred over extended-release/long-acting opioids for chronic pain. Clinicians are encouraged to engage residents in proactive strategies in managing their pain, and to set realistic expectations toward improving their quality of life, as complete elimination of pain is not feasible in most cases. This review article provides the interdisciplinary team with a contemporary perspective of the multitude of changes and challenges influencing the prescribing as well as deprescribing of various pain medications.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Objective: To examine the changes in choriocapillaris and retina caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by comparing optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) findings of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. Methods: The study and control groups consisted of 54 eyes of 27 participants, each. Patients and controls underwent OCTA examination. Foveal zone vessel density and parafoveal zone vessel density (for 4 quadrants: nasal, temporal, superior, inferior) were calculated for both superficial and deep capillary plexuses. Additionally, choriocapillaris flow and foveal avascular zone areas were calculated. Results: For the parafoveal area in the study group, vessel density was significantly lower in the superior and nasal quadrants of the superficial capillary plexus and in all quadrants of the deep capillary plexus compared with controls (p &lt; 0.05 for all). The study group had significantly higher choriocapillaris flow area values compared with controls (p = 0.042). Conclusion: Reduced vessel density of the retinal capillary plexus was detected in COVID-19 patients who may be at risk for retinal vascular complications.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>The spread of the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been intensifying in the past year, posing a huge threat to global health. There is an urgent need for effective drugs and vaccines to fight the COVID-19, but their advent may not be quite fast. Drug repurposing is a feasible strategy in the current situation, which could greatly shorten drug development time and help to response quickly to the novel virus outbreak. It has been reported that histamine H1 receptor antagonists have broad-spectrum antiviral effects. Therefore, in this study, we aim to screen potential drugs among histamine H1 receptor antagonists that may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the model of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) overexpressing HEK293T cell membrane chromatography (CMC), five FDA-approved histamine H1 receptor antagonists were found to have bioaffinity to ACE2. Then we determined the interaction between these drugs and ACE2 by frontal analysis and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which consistently demonstrated that these hits bind to ACE2 at micromolar levels of affinity. Through the pseudovirus assay, we finally identified that doxepin could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus from entering the ACE2-expressing cell, reducing the infection rate to 25.82%. These preliminary results indicate that the histamine H1 receptor antagonist, doxepin, is a viable drug candidate for clinical trials. Therefore, we hope the work timely provides rational help for developing anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs to control the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2.</Abstract>

        <Title>Identifying anti-coronavirus peptides by incorporating different negative datasets and imbalanced learning strategies Identifying anti-coronavirus peptides by incorporating different negative datasets and imbalanced learning strategies</Title>
        <Abstract>As the current worldwide outbreaks of the SARS-CoV-2, it is urgently needed to develop effective therapeutic agents for inhibiting the pathogens or treating the related diseases. Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) with functional activity against coronavirus could be a considerable solution, yet there is no research for identifying anti-coronavirus (anti-CoV) peptides with the computational approach. In this study, we first investigated the physiochemical and compositional properties of the collected anti-CoV peptides by comparing against three other negative sets: antivirus peptides without anti-CoV function (antivirus), regular AMP without antivirus functions (non-AVP) and peptides without antimicrobial functions (non-AMP). Then, we established classifiers for identifying anti-CoV peptides between different negative sets based on random forest. Imbalanced learning strategies were adopted due to the severe class-imbalance within the datasets. The geometric mean of the sensitivity and specificity (GMean) under the identification from antivirus, non-AVP and non-AMP reaches 83.07%, 85.51% and 98.82%, respectively. Then, to pursue identifying anti-CoV peptides from broad-spectrum peptides, we designed a double-stages classifier based on the collected datasets. In the first stage, the classifier characterizes AMPs from regular peptides. It achieves an area under the receiver operating curve (AUCROC) value of 97.31%. The second stage is to identify the anti-CoV peptides between the combined negatives of other AMPs. Here, the GMean of evaluation on the independent test set is 79.42%. The proposed approach is considered as an applicable scheme for assisting the development of novel anti-CoV peptides. The datasets and source codes used in this study are available at https://github.com/poncey/PreAntiCoV.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. China reported the first case of COVID-19 in December 2019, and a few months later, the World Health Organization declared it as a pandemic. Oral ulcers in adult patients have been associated with COVID-19. However, no cases have yet been documented in children. The angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor has been identified in tissues of the oral cavity. Studies have identified the tongue as the site with the highest expression of ACE2, and the oral epithelium, gingival epithelium, and salivary glands as sites of lesser extent expression. ACE2 expression is lower in children and varies with age. SARS-CoV-2 in saliva has been identified in various studies, which suggests that this could be a useful sample for diagnosis. However, its presence in saliva would indicate the high risk of contagion of this fluid.</Abstract>

        <Title>Distinct antibody repertoires against endemic human coronaviruses in children and adults Distinct antibody repertoires against endemic human coronaviruses in children and adults</Title>
        <Abstract>Four endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are commonly associated with acute respiratory infection in humans. B cell responses to these "common cold" viruses remain incompletely understood. Here we report a comprehensive analysis of CoV-specific antibody repertoires in 231 children and 1168 adults using phage-immunoprecipitation sequencing. Seroprevalence of antibodies to endemic HCoVs ranged between ~4 and 27% depending on the species and cohort. We identified at least 136 novel linear B cell epitopes. Antibody repertoires against endemic HCoVs were qualitatively different between children and adults in that anti-HCoV IgG specificities more frequently found among children targeted functionally important and structurally conserved regions of the spike, nucleocapsid and matrix proteins. Moreover, antibody specificities targeting the highly conserved fusion peptide region and S2' cleavage site of the spike protein were broadly cross-reactive with peptides of epidemic human and non-human coronaviruses. In contrast, an acidic tandem repeat in the N-terminal region of the Nsp3 subdomain of the HCoV-HKU1 polyprotein was the predominant target of antibody responses in adult donors. Our findings shed light on the dominant species-specific and pan-CoV target sites of human antibody responses to coronavirus infection, thereby providing important insights for the development of prophylactic or therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccine design.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Purpose: To evaluate the longitudinal changes in retinal vessel diameters in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: This study included 25 patients with COVID-19 (Group 1) and 25 healthy subjects (Group 2). The diameters of peripapillary temporal and nasal retinal arteries and veins were measured at baseline and at 4 months after remission. Results: The baseline diameters of the inferior temporal vein and the artery were increased in group 1 compared to controls (p = .007 and p = .041, respectively). There was also an increase in the diameters of the inferior and superior nasal veins and arteries in group 1 at baseline (p = .001, p = .019, p = .037, and p = .008, respectively). Retinal vessel diameters decreased after remission in all quadrants in comparison to baseline measurements (all p &lt; .05). Conclusion: Increased retinal vessel diameters were measured in COVID-19 patients during the disease. Measurement of retinal vessel diameters may be a noninvasive method of estimating the vascular risk.</Abstract>

        <Title>Dynamic assessment of interleukin-6 during hemodialysis and mortality in COVID 19 Dynamic assessment of interleukin-6 during hemodialysis and mortality in COVID 19</Title>
        <Abstract>The impact of the newly discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in hemodialysis patients remains poorly characterized. Some hemodialysis techniques reduce systemic inflammation but their impact on COVID-19 has not been addressed. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate factors associated with mortality in COVID-19 hemodialysis patients, including the impact of reducing interleukin-6 using a cytokine adsorbent filter. This is a prospective single-center study including 16 hemodialysis patients with COVID-19. All were dialyzed using a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) filter. Interleukin-6 levels were obtained before and after the first admission hemodialysis session and at one week. Baseline comorbidities, laboratory values, chest X-ray and treatments were recorded and compared between survivors and non-survivors. Out of sixteen patients (13 males, mean age 72±15 years), four (25%) died. Factors associated with mortality were dialysis vintage (p=0.01), chest X-ray infiltrates (p=0.032), serum C-reactive protein (p=0.05) and lactate dehydrogenase (p=0.02) at one week, oxygen therapy requirement (p=0.02) and anticoagulation (p&lt;0.01). At admission, non-survivors had higher pre and post-dialysis interleukin-6 levels (p=0.02 for both) and did not present the reduction of interleukin-6 levels during the dialysis session with PMMA filter that was observed in survivors (survivors vs non-survivors (25.0 [17.5-53.2] %vs -2.8 [-109.4-12.8] % reduction, p=0.04). A positive balance of interleukin-6 during the admission dialysis was associated with mortality (p=0.008). In conclusion, in hemodialysis COVID-19 patients, a positive interleukin-6 balance during the admission hemodialysis session was associated with higher mortality.

        <Abstract>Background: While studies from large cities affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have reported on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of universal testing during admission for delivery, the patient demographic, social and clinical factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women are not fully understood. Objective: To evaluate the epidemiological factors associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in women admitted for labour and delivery, in the context of universal screening at four Boston-area hospitals. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, we reviewed the health records of all women admitted for labour and delivery at four hospitals from the largest health system in Massachusetts between 19 April 2020 and 27 June 2020. We calculated the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including asymptomatic infection. We calculated associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection and demographic and clinical characteristics. Results: A total of 93 patients (3.2%, 95% confidence interval 2.5, 3.8) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on admission for labour and delivery out of 2945 patients included in the analysis; 80 (86.0%) of the patients who tested positive were asymptomatic at the time of testing. Factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection included the following: younger age, obesity, African American or Hispanic race/ethnicity, residence in heavily affected communities (as measured in cases reported per capita), presence of a household member with known SARS-CoV-2 infection, non-health care essential worker occupation and MassHealth or Medicaid insurance compared to commercial insurance. 93.8% of patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 on admission had one or more identifiable factors associated with disease acquisition. Conclusions: In this large sample of deliveries during the height of the surge in infections during the spring of 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infection was largely concentrated in patients with distinct demographic characteristics, those largely from disadvantaged communities. Racial disparities seen in pregnancy persist with respect to SARS-CoV-2 infection.</Abstract>

New viruses, drug-resistant bacteria, and fungi continue to challenge the human efficacious drug bank. Researchers have developed a variety of new antiviral and antibacterial drugs in response to the infectious disease crisis. Meanwhile, the development of functional materials has also improved therapeutic outcomes. As a natural material, chitosan possesses good biocompatibility, bioactivity, and biosafety. It has been proven that the cooperation between chitosan and traditional medicine greatly improves the ability of anti-infection. This review summarized the application and design considerations of chitosan-composed systems for the treatment of infectious diseases, looking forward to providing the idea of infectious disease therapy.</Abstract>

        <Title>Prevalence and Risk Factors Associated With Self-reported Psychological Distress Among Children and Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic in China Prevalence and Risk Factors Associated With Self-reported Psychological Distress Among Children and Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic in China</Title>
        <Abstract>Importance: Schools have been suspended nationwide in 188 countries, and classes have shifted to home-based distance learning models to control the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Additional information is needed to determine mental health status among school-aged children and adolescents during this public health crisis and the risk factors associated with psychological distress during the pandemic. Objective: To assess self-reported psychological distress among school-aged children and adolescents associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, setting, and participants: This cross-sectional study using data from a survey on the mental health of school-aged children and adolescents in Guangdong province, China, conducted by using a stratified cluster random sampling method between March 8 to 30, 2020. To estimate outcomes associated with location of districts, only data from students with internet protocol addresses and current addresses in Guangdong were included. Data were analyzed from April 5 to July 20, 2020. Exposure: Home-based distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Main outcome and measures: The main outcome was self-reported psychological distress, measured using the total score on the 12-item General Health Questionnaire of 3 or greater. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze risk factors associated with mental health status. Odds ratios (ORs) were used to analyze the associations of factors with psychological distress. Results: Among 1 310 600 students who completed the survey, 1 199 320 students (mean [SD] age, 12.04 [3.01] years; 619 144 [51.6%] boys) were included in the final analysis. A total of 126 355 students (10.5%) self-reported psychological distress. Compared with students in primary school, high school students had increased risk of psychological distress (OR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.15-1.23]). Compared with students who wore a face mask frequently, students who never wore a face mask had increased risk of psychological distress (OR, 2.59 [95% CI, 2.41-2.79]). Additionally, students who spent less than 0.5 hours exercising had increased odds of self-reported psychological distress compared with students who spent more than 1 hour exercising (OR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.61-1.67]). Conclusions and relevance: These findings suggest that the prevalence of self-reported psychological distress among students during the COVID-19 pandemic was relatively high. Frequency of wearing a face mask and time spent exercising were factors associated with mental health. Therefore, it may be necessary for governments, schools, and families to pay attention to the mental health of school-aged children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic and take corresponding countermeasures to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on students' mental health.</Abstract>

        <Title>Peri-operative echocardiography for lung transplantation in a critical patient with COVID-19 Peri-operative echocardiography for lung transplantation in a critical patient with COVID-19</Title>
        <Abstract>Critical patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) suffer from severe illness and have a high mortality rate. Lung transplantation may be the final option for a subset of these patients. Herein we report the important role of peri-operative echocardiography in a COVID-19 patient who underwent bilateral lung transplantation because of severe respiratory failure. The precise evaluation provided by echocardiography enabled the prevention of anastomotic complications and the successful management of haemodynamic instability. Echocardiographers should be familiar with the complications of lung transplantation and the haemodynamics under extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support to achieve a more accurate interpretation of cardiac parameters.</Abstract>

        <Title>The Novel Coronavirus Enigma: Phylogeny and Analyses of Coevolving Mutations Among the SARS-CoV-2 Viruses Circulating in India The Novel Coronavirus Enigma: Phylogeny and Analyses of Coevolving Mutations Among the SARS-CoV-2 Viruses Circulating in India</Title>
        <Abstract>Background: The RNA genome of the emerging novel coronavirus is rapidly mutating, and its human-to-human transmission rate is increasing. Hence, temporal dissection of their evolutionary dynamics, the nature of variations among different strains, and understanding the single nucleotide polymorphisms in the endemic settings are crucial. Delineating the heterogeneous genomic constellations of this novel virus will help us understand its complex behavior in a particular geographical region. Objective: This is a comprehensive analysis of 95 Indian SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences available from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) repository during the first 6 months of 2020 (January through June). Evolutionary dynamics, gene-specific phylogeny, and the emergence of the novel coevolving mutations in 9 structural and nonstructural genes among circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains across 12 different Indian states were analyzed. Methods: A total of 95 SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences submitted from India were downloaded from the GISAID database. Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis, version X software was used to construct the 9 phylogenetic dendrograms based on nucleotide sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 genes. Analyses of the coevolving mutations were done in comparison to the prototype SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan, China. The secondary structure of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase/nonstructural protein NSP12 was predicted with respect to the novel A97V mutation. Results: Phylogenetic analyses revealed the evolution of "genome-type clusters" and adaptive selection of "L"-type SARS-CoV-2 strains with genetic closeness to the bat severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses. These strains were distant to pangolin or Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus strains. With regard to the novel coevolving mutations, 2 groups have been seen circulating in India at present, the "major group" (66/95, 69.4%) and the "minor group" (21/95, 22.1%) , harboring 4 and 5 coexisting mutations, respectively. The "major group" mutations fall in the A2a clade. All the minor group mutations, except 11083G&gt;T (L37F, NSP6 gene), were unique to the Indian isolates. Conclusions: This study highlights the rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus and the cocirculation of multiple clades and subclades. This comprehensive study is a potential resource for monitoring the novel mutations in the viral genome, interpreting changes in viral pathogenesis, and designing vaccines or other therapeutics.</Abstract>

        <Title>Analysis of Hospital Resource Availability and COVID-19 Mortality Across the United States Analysis of Hospital Resource Availability and COVID-19 Mortality Across the United States</Title>
        <Abstract>While the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has varied greatly across the United States, there has been little assessment of hospital resources and mortality. We examine hospital resources and death counts among hospital referral regions (HRRs) from March 1 to July 26, 2020. This was an analysis of American Hospital Association data with COVID-19 data from the New York Times. Hospital-based resource availabilities were characterized per COVID-19 case. Death count was defined by monthly confirmed COVID-19 deaths. Geographic areas with fewer intensive care unit (ICU) beds (incident rate ratio [IRR], 0.194; 95% CI, 0.076-0.491), nurses (IRR, 0.927; 95% CI, 0.888-0.967), and general medicine/surgical beds (IRR, 0.800; 95% CI, 0.696-0.920) per COVID-19 case were statistically significantly associated with greater deaths in April. This underscores the potential impact of innovative hospital capacity protocols and care models to create resource flexibility to limit system overload early in a pandemic.</Abstract>

        <Title>Toward Rapid and Sensitive Detection of SARS-CoV-2 with Functionalized Magnetic Nanoparticles Toward Rapid and Sensitive Detection of SARS-CoV-2 with Functionalized Magnetic Nanoparticles</Title>
        <Abstract>The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) threatens global medical systems and economies and rules our daily living life. Controlling the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has become one of the most important and urgent strategies throughout the whole world. As of October 2020, there have not yet been any medicines or therapies to be effective against SARS-CoV-2. Thus, rapid and sensitive diagnostics is the most important measures to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Homogeneous biosensing based on magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) is one of the most promising approaches for rapid and highly sensitive detection of biomolecules. This paper proposes an approach for rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 with functionalized MNPs via the measurement of their magnetic response in an ac magnetic field. For proof of concept, mimic SARS-CoV-2 consisting of spike proteins and polystyrene beads are used for experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach allows the rapid detection of mimic SARS-CoV-2 with a limit of detection of 0.084 nM (5.9 fmole). The proposed approach has great potential for designing a low-cost and point-of-care device for rapid and sensitive diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2.</Abstract>

        <Title>Lung Ultrasound for Identification of Patients Requiring Invasive Mechanical Ventilation in COVID-19 Lung Ultrasound for Identification of Patients Requiring Invasive Mechanical Ventilation in COVID-19</Title>
        <Abstract>Objectives: Indication for invasive mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 pneumonia has been a major challenge. This study aimed to evaluate if lung ultrasound (LUS) can assist identification of requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation in moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Materials and methods: Between April 23 and November 12, 2020, hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 (oxygen demand ≥4 L/min) were included consecutively. Lung ultrasound was performed daily until invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV-group) or spontaneous recovery (non-IMV-group). Clinical parameters and lung ultrasound findings were compared between groups, at intubation (IMV-group) and highest oxygen demand (non-IMV-group). A reference group with oxygen demand &lt;4 L/min was examined at hospital admission. Results: Altogether 72 patients were included: 50 study patients (IMV-group, n = 23; non-IMV-group, n = 27) and 22 reference patients. LUS-score correlated to oxygen demand (SpO2 /FiO2 -ratio) (r = 0.728; p &lt; 0.0001) and was higher in the IMV-group compared to the non-IMV-group (20.0 versus 18.0; p = 0.026). Based on receiver operating characteristic analysis, a LUS-score of 19.5 was identified as cut-off for requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation (area under the curve 0.68; sensitivity 56%, specificity 74%). In 6 patients, LUS identified critical coexisting conditions. Respiratory rate and oxygenation index ((SpO2 /FiO2 )/respiratory rate) ≥4.88 identified no requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation with a positive predictive value of 87% and negative predictive value of 100%. Conclusions: LUS-score had only a moderate diagnostic value for requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation in moderate to severe COVID-19. However, LUS proved valuable as complement to respiratory parameters in guidance of disease severity and identifying critical coexisting conditions.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>The lack of population health surveillance for companion animal populations leaves them vulnerable to the effects of novel diseases without means of early detection. We present evidence on the effectiveness of a system that enabled early detection and rapid response a canine gastroenteritis outbreak in the United Kingdom. In January 2020, prolific vomiting among dogs was sporadically reported in the United Kingdom. Electronic health records from a nationwide sentinel network of veterinary practices confirmed a significant increase in dogs with signs of gastroenteric disease. Male dogs and dogs living with other vomiting dogs were more likely to be affected. Diet and vaccination status were not associated with the disease; however, a canine enteric coronavirus was significantly associated with illness. The system we describe potentially fills a gap in surveillance in neglected populations and could provide a blueprint for other countries.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>To improve recognition of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and inform clinical and public health guidance, we randomly selected 600 COVID-19 case-patients in Colorado. A telephone questionnaire captured symptoms experienced, when symptoms occurred, and how long each lasted. Among 128 hospitalized patients, commonly reported symptoms included fever (84%), fatigue (83%), cough (73%), and dyspnea (72%). Among 236 nonhospitalized patients, commonly reported symptoms included fatigue (90%), fever (83%), cough (83%), and myalgia (74%). The most commonly reported initial symptoms were cough (21%-25%) and fever (20%-25%). In multivariable analysis, vomiting, dyspnea, altered mental status, dehydration, and wheezing were significantly associated with hospitalization, whereas rhinorrhea, headache, sore throat, and anosmia or ageusia were significantly associated with nonhospitalization. General symptoms and upper respiratory symptoms occurred earlier in disease, and anosmia, ageusia, lower respiratory symptoms, and gastrointestinal symptoms occurred later. Symptoms should be considered alongside other epidemiologic factors in clinical and public health decisions regarding potential COVID-19 cases.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Greece imposed a nationwide lockdown in March 2020 to mitigate transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 during the first epidemic wave. We conducted a survey on age-specific social contact patterns to assess effects of physical distancing measures and used a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to simulate the epidemic. Because multiple distancing measures were implemented simultaneously, we assessed their overall effects and the contribution of each measure. Before measures were implemented, the estimated basic reproduction number (R0) was 2.38 (95% CI 2.01-2.80). During lockdown, daily contacts decreased by 86.9% and R0 decreased by 81.0% (95% credible interval [CrI] 71.8%-86.0%); each distancing measure decreased R0 by 10%-24%. By April 26, the attack rate in Greece was 0.12% (95% CrI 0.06%-0.26%), one of the lowest in Europe, and the infection fatality ratio was 1.12% (95% CrI 0.55%-2.31%). Multiple social distancing measures contained the first epidemic wave in Greece.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Objectives: Research during prior virus outbreaks has examined vulnerability factors associated with increased anxiety and fear. Design: We explored numerous psychopathology, sociodemographic, and virus exposure-related variables associated with anxiety and perceived threat of death regarding COVID-19. Method: We recruited 908 adults from Eastern China for a cross-sectional web survey, from 24 February to 15 March 2020, when social distancing was heavily enforced in China. We used several machine learning algorithms to train our statistical model of predictor variables in modeling COVID-19-related anxiety, and perceived threat of death, separately. We trained the model using many simulated replications on a random subset of participants, and subsequently externally tested on the remaining subset of participants. Results: Shrinkage machine learning algorithms performed best, indicating that stress and rumination were the most important variables in modeling COVID-19-related anxiety severity. Health anxiety was the most potent predictor of perceived threat of death from COVID-19. Conclusions: Results are discussed in the context of research on anxiety and fear from prior virus outbreaks, and from theory on outbreak-related emotional vulnerability. Implications regarding COVID-19-related anxiety are also discussed.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Background: Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction are frequently reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the reported prevalence of olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunction varies widely, and the reason for the inter-study differences is unclear. Hence, in this meta-analysis, we performed subgroup analyses to investigate the factors that contribute to the inter-study variability in the prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction. Methods: Out of 943 citations, we included 55 eligible studies with 13,527 patients with COVID-19 for a meta-analysis. Calculating the data extracted from each study, the weighted summary prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction was estimated using a Freeman-Tukey transformation with models based on random-effects assumptions. A meta-analysis of variance compared the prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction according to regional, chronological, demographic, and methodologic factors, respectively. Results: The overall pooled prevalence rates of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction were 51.4% and 47.5%, respectively, in the random-effect model. In subgroup analyses, the prevalence rates of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction were significantly different among four geographical regions (both P &lt; 0.001, respectively). Although the prevalence rates of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction did not significantly differ according to the time of enrollment, the subgroup analyses including only studies from the same geographical region (Europe) revealed a significant difference in olfactory dysfunction according to the time of enrollment. Conclusion: The regional and chronological differences in the prevalence rates of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions partly explain the wide inter-study variability.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks emerged at two university-affiliated hospitals in Seoul (hospital A) and Uijeongbu City (hospital S) in the metropolitan Seoul area in March 2020. The aim of this study was to investigate epidemiological links between the outbreaks using whole genome sequencing (WGS) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods: Fifteen patients were enrolled in the study, including four non-outbreak (A1-A4) and three outbreak cases (A5-A7) in hospital A and eight cases (S1-S8) in hospital S. Patients' hospital stays, COVID-19 symptoms, and transfer history were reviewed. RNA samples were submitted for WGS and genome-wide single nucleotide variants and phylogenetic relationships were analyzed. Results: The index patient (A5) in hospital A was transferred from hospital S on 26 March. Patients A6 and A7 were the family caregiver and sister, respectively, of the patient who shared a room with A5 for 4 days. Prior to transfer, A5 was at the next bed to S8 in the emergency room on 25 March. Patient S6, a professional caregiver, took care of the patient in the room next to S8's room for 5 days until 22 March and then S5 for another 3 days. WGS revealed that SARS-CoV-2 in A2, A3, and A4 belong to clades V/B.2, S/A, and G/B.1, respectively, whereas that of A5-A7 and S1-S5 are of the V/B.2.1 clade and closely clustered. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 in patients A5 and S5 showed perfect identity. Conclusion: WGS is a useful tool to understand epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. It is the first study to elucidate the role of patient transfer and caregivers as links of nosocomial outbreaks of COVID-19 in multiple hospitals.</Abstract>
