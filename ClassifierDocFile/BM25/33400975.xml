        <Abstract>The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to a rapid search for therapeutic and preventive measures. The impetus for this is the potentially severe course of infection. In regard to drug therapies, the antiviral drug, remdesivir, and the anti-inflammatory agent, dexamethasone, have shown some beneficial effects. Since a COVID-19 vaccine is not currently available, various additional treatment options are being evaluated. One of these, passive immunization, has shown promise in some studies. More research, however, is needed to determine the utility of immunotherapy with convalescent plasma or artificially produced monoclonal antibodies, for the treatment of symptomatic patients and potentially for use as post-exposure prophylaxis, at least until more effective drugs or a safe and effective vaccine become available.</Abstract>
