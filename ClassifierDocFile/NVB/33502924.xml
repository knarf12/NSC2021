        <Abstract>Persons living with spinal cord injury (SCI) are potentially at risk for severe COVID-19 disease given that they often have decreased lung capacity and may lack the ability to effectively evacuate their lungs. Known risk factors for negative outcomes after COVID-19, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, disproportionally affect people with SCI and raise concerns for the mortality risk among persons with SCI. A rapid systematic review of English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Chinese literature on COVID-19 and SCI was performed using the keywords "spinal cord injury" and "COVID-19." We included studies that provided information on clinical presentation, characteristics, course, and outcomes of COVID-19 disease in SCI. We excluded studies on patients who did not have an SCI before severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection or did not report clinical information. We included 10 studies in total: nine studies with a total of 171 patients and a survey study of 783 healthcare professionals. Fever (74%), cough (52%), and dyspnea (33%) were the most frequently reported symptoms, and 63% showed abnormalities on X-ray imaging. In the included case series and reports (N = 31), only 1 patient required mechanical ventilation, but 3 patients died (10%). The mortality rate in a large registry study (N = 140) was 19%. Clinical presentation of COVID-19 in SCI patients was similar to the general population, and though adverse events and intensive care unit admission were low, the mortality rate was high (10-19%). No prognostic factors for severe disease or mortality could be identified. Registration (PROSPERO): CRD42020196565.</Abstract>
