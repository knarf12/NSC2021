        <Abstract>Objective: When child and adolescent psychiatry fellowship applicants are applying to programs, many will use fellowship websites to gather information. This study assesses the accessibility and content available on child and adolescent fellowship websites. Methods: Using the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) list of child and adolescent fellowship programs for 2020, 139 child and adolescent fellowship training websites were compiled. Information on websites was evaluated within the following three categories: program overview, application information and recruitment, and educational opportunities. A total of 22 criteria were evaluated within these three categories. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the websites. Results: A list provided by ERAS and a Google search identified child and adolescent fellowship program websites. Analysis of content revealed most websites included an overview of the program (97.8%), but fewer included information such as the number of fellowship spots (51.5%), salary (45.5%), application deadline (41.0%), and call responsibility (19.4%). Conclusion: Results suggest there is room for improvement in the comprehensiveness and accessibility of child and adolescent fellowship websites. Especially during a time when much of the programmatic information will be obtained virtually due to COVID-19, it is critical that fellowship websites are uniformly curated so applicants can more easily find information about programs.</Abstract>
