        <Abstract>The current COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 19) pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, disproportionally affects the elderly and people with comorbidities like obesity and associated type 2 diabetes mellitus. Small animal models are crucial for the successful development and validation of antiviral vaccines, therapies and to study the role that comorbidities have on the outcome of viral infections. The initially available SARS-CoV-2 isolates require adaptation in order to use the mouse angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (mACE-2) entry receptor and to productively infect the cells of the murine respiratory tract. We have "mouse-adapted" SARS-CoV-2 by serial passaging a clinical virus isolate in the lungs of mice. We then used low doses of this virus in mouse models for advanced age, diabetes and obesity. Similar to SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, the outcome of infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 resulted in enhanced morbidity in aged and diabetic obese mice. Mutations associated with mouse adaptation occurred in the S, M, N and ORF8 genes. Interestingly, one mutation in the receptor binding domain of the S protein results in the change of an asparagine to tyrosine residue at position 501 (N501Y). This mutation is also present in the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant viruses reported in the U.K. (20B/501Y.V1, B1.1.7 lineage) that is epidemiologically associated with high human to human transmission. We show that human convalescent and post vaccination sera can neutralize the newly emerging N501Y virus variant with similar efficiency as that of the reference USA-WA1/2020 virus, suggesting that current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will protect against the 20B/501Y.V1 strain.</Abstract>
