        <Abstract>Information on the impact of ABO blood group (BG) on SARS-CoV-2 infections is conflicting (1-4). To identify risk factors for severe COVID-19 courses we performed a cross-sectional study in volunteers between 18 and 61 years of age registered with DKMS for stem cell donation approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Technische Universit√§t Dresden. All participants provided explicit consent that COVID-19 specific data were linked to genotype data in the donor registry file.</Abstract>
