        <Abstract>The holiday season, Christmas to New Year, is the most festive period of each year in the Philippines. However, the beginning of the festive holiday season in the Philippines seems to be a predicament to healthcare workers and professionals especially during this coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The holiday season is considered a health risk in the Philippines because of the change of lifestyle leading to the increased number of health consultancies and hospitalization. Thus, the expected surge of people in the hospitals and clinics pose an added stress to healthcare workers and professionals. Pre-Holiday policies and programs are therefore essentials especially during the course of battling COVID-19.</Abstract>
