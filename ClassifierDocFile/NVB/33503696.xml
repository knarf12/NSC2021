        <Abstract>The studies on infectiousness of person infected with SARS-CoV-2 at different stages of illness are an important basis for making effective prevention and control measures such as investigating the infectious source, determining the scope of close contacts and the timing of case isolation. This review discusses the infectiousness of cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the incubation period, symptomatic period and convalescent period by reviewing national and international literatures, technical and professional guidelines. Existing researches suggest that the infectious viruses could be isolated at the end of the incubation period as well as since illness onset, and viral load in upper respiratory tract swabs reached the peak on day 4-6 after illness onset and thereafter began to decline, implying the infectiousness was relatively strong at the end of incubation period and within one week after illness onset. Although there were a few cases who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after recovery, no evidence was found to indicate these cases can cause the transmission.</Abstract>
