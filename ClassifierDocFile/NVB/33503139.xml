        <Abstract>The current Covid-19 pandemic has been the most discussed topic of the year, mostly about protection and ways to avoid dissemination of the virus. In the healthcare system, especially in the operating rooms, the viability of laparoscopic surgery was questioned, mostly because of the transmission through aerosol. This article tries to suggest a way to minimize risks of laparoscopic surgery, during this situation, by using electrostatic filters, a simple, effective and low cost alternative.</Abstract>
