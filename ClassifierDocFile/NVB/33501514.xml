        <Abstract>Background: Hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have a high morbidity and mortality and are often dependent on intensive care, especially mechanical ventilation. Little is as yet known about COVID-19 patient allocation. Objectives: Analysis of the structures of German hospital care for COVID-19 patients up to July 2020 in terms of number of beds and previous ventilation experience. Data and methods: For the analysis of the care structures, only completed COVID-19 cases in which the virus was detected by a PCR test were evaluated. Claims data from the German Local Health Care Funds (Allgemeine Ortskrankenkassen, AOK) were analysed. The sample includes 17,094 COVID-19 cases that were treated in 1082 hospitals. Results: A total of 77% of all hospitals participated in the treatment COVID-19 patients and 48% of all hospitals provided intensive care for these patients. One half of the hospitals that treated COVID-19 cases cared for 88% of all cases. Although this suggests a centralization effect of COVID-19 cases in specific hospitals, the remaining 12% of the cases were distributed among many hospitals with often very small numbers of cases. Furthermore, 23% of the ventilated COVID-19 cases were treated in hospitals with below-average ventilation experience. Conclusions: In the context of increasing numbers of infections, it is both necessary to improve the allocation of hospitalized, and therefore potentially ventilated, COVID-19 cases by means of clearly defined and centrally controlled pyramid-type concepts and to continue to care for patients without COVID-19. For Germany, a comprehensive pyramid-type concept with a greater concentration in the best-qualified hospitals seems reasonable for the care of these patients with complex diseases.</Abstract>
