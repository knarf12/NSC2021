        <Abstract>Background: The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has been rapidly spreading throughout the world with confirmed case numbers already exceeding 75 millions. Although nasopharyngeal swabs are the most commonly utilized samples for based SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, collecting these specimens requires healthcare workers and necessitates the use of personal protective equipment since it presents a nosocomial transmission risk. We aimed to assess the diagnostic value of saliva samples in mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with confirmed Covid-19. Methods: We did a cohort study to validate the use of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection in mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19. Saliva samples of the patients were analyzed by RT-PCR. Results: In May 2020, 28 asymptomatic and 25 mildly symptomatic patients were enrolled in the study. The median age was 37 years (range 4-70). None of the patients had fever on presentation. Among 53 patients with SARS-CoV-2 detected in the nasopharyngeal sample, the real-time RT-PCR was positive in the saliva specimens in 48 (90.56%) patients. The mean cycle threshold (CT) values for nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens (27.80±3.44 and 30.64±2.83, respectively) were significantly correlated between the two sample types (p=0.016). The mean CT values of nasopharyngeal and saliva samples in mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (27.18±3.53 and 30.24±3.29 vs. 28.36±3.31 and 30.98±2.39, respectively) were not significantly different (p=0.236 and p=0.733, respectively). Conclusions: Saliva specimens can be considered as a reliable and less resource intensive alternative to nasopharyngeal specimens for screening asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.
