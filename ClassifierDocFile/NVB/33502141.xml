        <Abstract>To date, there is lack of specific effective treatment or vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2, and clinical and laboratory research is still ongoing to find successful drugs. Therefore, prevention to be infected through social distancing and isolation is the most effective way. However, all the other physical and mental illnesses continue to exist, if possible even more burdened by the emergency situation and social distancing. The COVID-19 pandemic, especially in many low- and middle-income countries, has caused a deeper gap in seeking psychiatric help. In this scenario, telepsychiatry could play a decisive role in implementing clinical care for frail patients and ensuring continuous mental care. Therefore, we felt the urge to write this article to express our hope that the old health care system at this time of crisis, as we know it, can offer the chance to implement pervasive care technologies that perfectly fit current psychiatric needs.</Abstract>
