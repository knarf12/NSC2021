        <Abstract>COVID-19- related patient care and research have focused on short-term outcomes, particularly among those with underlying or preexisting medical conditions. A major focus has been on mortality rates. Broadening the dialogue is neither meant nor intended to disparage the near-term devastation felt globally each day, but rather to begin preparation for optimally caring for and addressing the needs of survivors. The sequelae of COVID-19 includes acute, subacute and chronic stages of the condition. If one applies current World Health Organization (WHO) statistics to calculate the global burden of disease, there are 98,000,000 COVID-19 survivors. The following editorial focuses on post-COVID sequelae as a continuum of patient care needs, as well as discovery and training opportunities in an academic setting.</Abstract>
