        <Abstract>The purpose of this guideline is to help healthcare professionals prevent, detect and manage acute kidney injury in adults in hospital with known or suspected COVID-19. This is important to improve outcomes and reduce the need for renal replacement therapy. NICE has also produced a COVID-19 rapid guideline on dialysis service delivery. This guideline focuses on what you need to stop or start doing during the pandemic. Follow the usual professional guidelines, standards and laws (including those on equalities, safeguarding, communication and mental capacity), as described in making decisions using NICE guidelines. This guideline is for: health and care practitioners health and care staff involved in planning and delivering services commissioners. The recommendations bring together: evidence from published literature on COVID-19 and acute kidney injury existing national and international guidance and policies (including NHS Englandâ€™s specialty guides: clinical guide on acute kidney injury in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 outside the intensive care unit during the coronavirus pandemic and clinical guide on renal replacement therapy options in critical care during the coronavirus pandemic) advice from specialists working in the NHS from across the UK. These include people with expertise and experience of treating patients with acute kidney injury during the current COVID-19 pandemic. We developed this guideline using the interim process and methods for developing rapid guidelines on COVID-19 in response to the rapidly evolving situation. We will review and update the recommendations as the knowledge base develops using the interim process and methods for guidelines developed in response to health and social care emergencies.</Abstract>
