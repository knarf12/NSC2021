        <Abstract>Genome-wide association studies have identified 3p21.31 as the main risk locus for severe symptoms and hospitalization in COVID-19 patients. To elucidate the mechanistic basis of this genetic association, we performed a comprehensive epigenomic dissection of the 3p21.31 locus. Our analyses pinpoint activating variants in regulatory regions of the chemokine receptor-encoding CCR1 gene as potentially pathogenic by enhancing infiltration of monocytes and macrophages into the lungs of patients with severe COVID-19.</Abstract>
