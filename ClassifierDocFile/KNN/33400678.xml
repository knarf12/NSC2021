        <Abstract>Background: The emerging COVID-19 is a severe health crisis worldwide. Wearing a mask was straightforward but shortage of stock and equity of allocation were important issues in Taiwan. Furthermore, increased anxiety leading to stockpiling of masks is common during the pandemic. Objective: We aimed to summarize the name-based mask rationing plan implemented in Taiwan and explore the perceived anxiety of mask shortage. Methods: The government of Taiwan took action to control the supply and allocation of facemasks. We summarize the timeline and important components of mask rationing plan. A simple survey with a 5-point scale questionnaire that aimed to investigate the overall responses to the mask rationing plan was conducted to 44 participants. Results: The mask rationing plan was implemented since late January 2020 and the daily production capacity increased from 2 millions masks to 16 millions in April 2020. People could buy 9 masks in 14 days by verification of national health insurance card. Software applications of face mask availability was demonstrated. Moreover, the mask plan safeguarded the purchase of masks and could result in a decrease in anxiety of mask shortage (4.05 ± 1.15 points, agree or strongly agree: 72.7% participants). And the majority of people felt that the mask plan was satisfactory (4.2±0.92 points, agree or strongly agree: 79.5%). Conclusions: We found the unique name-based mask rationing plan could control the production, supply of masks, and contribute to the appropriate allocation of masks. It may not only provide physical barriers, but also result in a reduction in the anxiety of mask shortage during the pandemic.</Abstract>
