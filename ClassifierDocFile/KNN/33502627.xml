        <Abstract>We evaluated the rates of viral respiratory co-infections among SARS-CoV-2-infected children. Twelve percent of SARS-CoV-2-infected children had viral co-infection with one or more common respiratory viruses. This was significantly more frequent than among their SARS-CoV-2-infected adult household contacts (0%; p=0.028). Compared to the same period the previous year, common respiratory viruses were less frequently detected (12% vs 73%, p&lt;0.001).Conclusion: Despite partial lockdown with school and daycare closure, and consequently similar exposure to common viruses between children and adults, SARS-CoV-2-infected children had more frequent viral respiratory co-infections than their SARS-CoV-2-infected adult household contacts. Circulation of common respiratory viruses was less frequent during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak when compared to the same period last year, showing the impact of partial lockdown on the circulation of common viruses. What is Known: • Viral respiratory co-infections are frequent in children. • SARS-CoV-2 can be identified alongside other respiratory viruses, but data comparing children and adults are lacking. What is New: • Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are more likely to have viral respiratory co-infections than their SARS-CoV-2-infected adult household contacts, which is surprising in the context of partial lockdown with schools and daycare closed. • When compared to data collected during the same period last year, our study also showed that partial lockdown reduced circulation of common respiratory viruses.</Abstract>
