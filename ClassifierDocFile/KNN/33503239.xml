        <Abstract>In January 2021, the incoming Biden administration will inherit urgent priorities to curb health care spending and expand health care coverage to millions of Americans while also addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic downturn. Among these competing priorities is the issue of access to and affordability of prescription drugs. Here, we outline Biden's plan to directly lower prescription drug spending for payers and patients and to expand access to prescription medications through improved health insurance coverage. These policies could provide important financial protections for Americans against high prescription drug prices. Despite widespread public support for addressing prescription drug prices, many of Biden's plans rely on Congressional action, which will be complicated by the narrow majority held by Democrats in the House and an evenly divided Senate. However, there may be other opportunities to reduce prescription drug spending and improve health insurance enrollment among the uninsured. While directly lowering drug prices would provide the most widespread savings for payers and patients alike, any successful effort to increase the number of Americans enrolled in health insurance or render it more affordable will still likely effectively lower patients' out-of-pocket costs and improve access to prescription drugs.</Abstract>
