        <Abstract>SARS-CoV-2 induced lower respiratory tract (LRT) disease can deteriorate to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Because the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is implicated in ARDS pathogenesis, we investigated the presence of NETs and correlates of pathogenesis in blood and LRT samples of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Plasma NET levels peaked early after ICU admission and correlated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in sputum and levels of neutrophil-recruiting chemokines and inflammatory markers in plasma. Baseline plasma NET quantity correlated with disease severity, but was not associated with soluble markers of thrombosis nor with development of thrombosis. High NET levels were present in LRT samples and persisted during the course of COVID-19, consistent with the detection of NETs in bronchi and alveolar spaces in lung tissue from fatal COVID-19 patients. Thus, NETs are produced and retained in the LRT of critical COVID-19 patients and could contribute to SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS pathology. .</Abstract>
