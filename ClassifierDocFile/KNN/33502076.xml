        <Abstract>Incretin-based therapies - GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors - have been hypothesized to exert beneficial effects on COVID-19 outcomes due to anti-inflammatory properties. In this population-based cohort study, we retrieved data from nationwide registries on all individuals diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection up to November 1, 2020. For individuals with diabetes, we examined the impact of use of GLP-1 receptor agonists (n=370 ) and DPP-4 inhibitors (n=284 ) compared to SGLT-2 inhibitors (n=342 ) on risk of hospital admission and severe outcomes. Relative risks (RR) were calculated after applying propensity score weighted methods to control for confounding. Current users of GLP-1 receptor agonists had an adjusted RR of 0.89 (95% CI 0.34-2.33) , while users of DPP-4 inhibitors had an adjusted RR of 2.42 (95% CI 0.99-5.89) for 30-day mortality compared to SGLT-2 inhibitor use. Further, use of GLP-1 receptor agonists or DPP-4 inhibitors compared to SGLT-2 inhibitors was not associated with decreased risk of hospital admission. Thus, use of incretin-based therapies in individuals with diabetes and SARS-CoV-2 was not associated with improved clinical outcomes. This article is protected by copyright.
