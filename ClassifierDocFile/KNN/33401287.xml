        <Abstract>The clinical spectrum of "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2" (SARS-CoV-2) infection is wider than initially thought. The coronavirus does not establish a chronic cellular infection, in contrast with HIV or the hepatitis B virus, that keeps their genomes, respectively, as proviruses integrated within the chromosomes or as episomes (Soriano et al. J Antimicrob Chemother 2014).</Abstract>
