        <Abstract>Background: In this viewpoint representatives of the Teaching Commission of the Anatomical Society summarize their teaching experiences gained during the COVID-19 pandemic in the summer term of 2020 and derive first recommendations concerning face-to-face and remote teaching of anatomy for the future. Methods: Representatives of the Teaching Commission of the Anatomical Society met virtually, exchanged experiences and summarized them in writing and answered a short questionnaire. Results: The required transition to remote learning during summer term of 2020 was possible, but revealed technical shortcomings and major deficits concerning practical hands-on teaching. Conclusion: The Teaching Commission of the Anatomical Society recommends that universities should follow the idea of as much face-to-face teaching as possible and as much online teaching as necessary for future terms.</Abstract>
